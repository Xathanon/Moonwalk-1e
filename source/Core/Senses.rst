Senses
======
It is necessary to perceive the world, and for an in-depth game with support for sneaking, perception and modes of it must be appropriately defined.

All things perceive the world through any number of senses, if they perceive it at all. Most objects have no senses. Plants have one, arguably two senses.
Humans, Extrahumans, and most creatures are assumed to have [Sense (Vision, Precise, Standard)] [Sense (Auditory, Imprecise, Standard)] [Sense (Olfactory, Imprecise, Standard)] [Sense (Tactile, Precise, Standard)] [Sense (Taste, Imprecise, Standard)].

A precise sense can provide a rendering of one's three-dimensional surroundings in a moment-to-moment view. Imprecise senses only provide rough direction and distance, such as standard human hearing. Senses are blocked by barriers, and creatures with [Sense Immunity (Sense)] may be utterly undetectable by certain senses regardless of precision and perception.

Range bands apply a -1 penalty per range band beyond the first to any Perception tests using the sense. After three range bands, a sense becomes imprecise if it was precise; after 5, the sense can no longer detect anything of note.

Modifiers:
----------
Different senses are subject to different modifiers. Each modifier has a category; Light, Moderate, and Great, which correspond to -1, -3, and -6 penalties respectively when applicable. If multiple modifiers would be at the same category, the modifier is bumped up one level. If multiple modifiers would be at Great, the sense becomes imprecise if was precise, and unusable if it was imprecise.
There is also a fourth level, Total. Total modifiers simply prevent the sense from being used, as if the character did not have it.

================ ========================
Sense            Applicable Modifier     
================ ========================
Visual           Light Level, Obscurement
Auditory         Wind, Sounds
Tactile          N/A
Olfactory        Wind*, Obscurement
Taste            N/A
Thermal          Temperature, Obscurement
Sonar/Ultrasound Sounds
Radar            Noise+
Astral           Background Count+
================ ========================

* Olfactory sense may benefit from wind if it's blowing in the right direction; in such situations, the penalty becomes a bonus.
* Noise and Background Count ignore the normal scale of penalties and are instead based on their ratings (see Noise and Background Counts for details)

*Light:*
Light levels drastically impact one's ability to see. Suboptimal light levels are known as glare (too much light) or darkness (too little light).

*Sounds:*
Sounds are interfering pressure waves in the air that can prevent effective hearing by overwhelming the auditory or sonar/ultrasound sense.

*Wind:*
Wind is a natural motion of the air from high-pressure to low-pressure states. It takes particles along with it and can interfere with air pressure waves.

*Obscurement:*
Obscurement is a general note for smoke, steam, or other intervening agents in the air that block incoming waves of detectable energy through the air.

*Noise:*
Noise is crowding or absence of ability to submit functional electromagnetic signals. Any Static or Spam zone applies its absolute value as a penalty to the Radar sense.

*Background Count:*
Background count is a rating-based system that describes an overflow or void of energy in the astral world that interferes with the use of magic and the perceiving of auras. Like noise, the rating of a background count applies as a penalty to the astral sense.

Barriers:
---------
Different senses are blocked by different things. Each type of barrier lists what kinds of senses it creates a Total modifier for.  Senses that are reduced from Precise to Imprecise by a barrier type are listed to the right, and also suffer from a Moderate modifier.

Line of "Sight"
---------------
Is not that simple. A line of sight using a sense means a straight line can be drawn between the source and the destination for at least one precise sense possessed by the source. Prefixing a specific sense's descriptor to the phrase implies the requisite that that line can be drawn with that particular sense (such as astral line of sight). Physical line of sight tends to refer to line of sight with all senses that are not Astral Sense. In sections referring to the Matrix, line of sight in the Matrix is line of sight determined as in the Matrix sense environment instead of in the physical one.


Spotting and Awareness:
-----------------------
A character has awareness of everything it can detect with any sense, unless that thing has successfully performed the Hide or Sneak actions. A character has spotted anything that its Standard Result for an Intuition + Perception [Mental] test would be sufficient to detect, as determined by the gamemaster. Spotting is occasionally referenced as knowing the location of a creature.

In combat, a creature becomes aware of all creatures in combat, but does not gain any knowledge of their locations unless it can detect them with a sense. A creature that is not aware of any of its attackers has not yet entered combat and is Unaware (as the condition).

Senses, the Matrix, and the Astral:
-----------------------------------
[Astral Essence] and the VR operating mode both move your consciousness out of your physical body. This deprives you of access to all of your senses - except those provided by your new mode of consciousness. The [Astral Essence] trait allows you to exclusively use the Astral Sense, which is gained from that trait. VR in turn simulates a visual environment (as in the vision sense) that is accommodated partially to other precise senses - the same things are presented to all users that have the same virtual location, so there's no seeing around corners in the Matrix if you have a natural precise ultrasound sense, but users who rely on other senses than sound can interact and perceive the Matrix normally.
