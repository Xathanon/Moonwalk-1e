Senses:
=======
It is necessary to perceive the world, and for an in-depth game with support for sneaking, perception and modes of it must be appropriately defined.

All things perceive the world through any number of senses, if they perceive it at all. Most objects have no senses. Plants have one, arguably two senses.
Humans, Extrahumans, and most creatures are assumed to have [Sense (Vision, Precise, Standard)] [Sense (Auditory, Imprecise, Standard)] [Sense (Olfactory, Imprecise, Standard)] [Sense (Tactile, Precise, Standard)] [Sense (Taste, Imprecise, Standard)].

A precise sense can provide a rendering of one's three-dimensional surroundings in a moment-to-moment view. Imprecise senses only provide rough direction and distance, such as standard human hearing. Senses are blocked by barriers, and creatures with [Sense Immunity (Sense)] may be utterly undetectable by certain senses regardless of precision and perception.

Range bands apply a -1 penalty per range band beyond the first to any Perception tests using the sense. After three range bands, a sense becomes imprecise if it was precise; after 5, the sense can no longer detect anything of note.


Barriers:
---------
Different senses are blocked by different things. Each type of barrier lists what kinds of senses it creates a Total modifier for.  Senses that are reduced from Precise to Imprecise by a barrier type are listed to the right, and also suffer from a Moderate modifier.

Modifiers:
----------
Different senses are subject to different modifiers. Each modifier has a category; Light, Moderate, and Great, which correspond to -1, -3, and -6 penalties respectively when applicable. If multiple modifiers would be at the same category, the modifier is bumped up one level. If multiple modifiers would be at Great, the sense becomes imprecise if was precise, and unusable if it was imprecise.
There is also a fourth level, Total. Total modifiers simply prevent the sense from being used, as if the character did not have it.
A few notes on exceptional instances in the Sense Modifiers Table:
* Olfactory sense may benefit from wind if it's blowing in the right direction; in such situations, the penalty becomes a bonus.
* Noise and Background Count ignore the normal scale of penalties and are instead based on their ratings (see Noise and Background Counts for details)

Spotting and Awareness:
-----------------------
A character has awareness of everything it can detect with any sense, unless that thing has successfully performed the Hide or Sneak actions. A character has spotted anything that its Standard Result for an Intuition + Perception [Mental] test would be sufficient to detect, as determined by the gamemaster. Spotting is occasionally referenced as knowing the location of a creature.
In combat, a creature becomes aware of all creatures in combat, but does not gain any knowledge of their locations unless it can detect them with a sense. A creature that is not aware of any of its attackers has not yet entered combat and is Unaware (as the condition).

Senses, the Matrix, and the Astral:
-----------------------------------
[Astral Essence] and the VR operating mode both move your consciousness out of your physical body. This deprives you of access to all of your senses - except those provided by your new mode of consciousness. The [Astral Essence] trait allows you to exclusively use the Astral Sense, which is gained from that trait. VR in turn simulates a visual environment (as in the vision sense) that is accommodated partially to other precise senses - the same things are presented to all users that have the same virtual location, so there's no seeing around corners in the Matrix if you have a natural precise ultrasound sense, but users who rely on other senses than sound can interact and perceive the Matrix normally.
