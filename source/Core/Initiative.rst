Initiative:
===========
When things come to a head in combat or tense social situations, it becomes important to know who acts in what order and how fast. To this end, the system of Initiative exists. Initiative consists of two parts: a stat sum depending on the initiative type, and a pool of turns, also depending on the initiative type. Fundamentally, you add up two stats, put each participant in order from highest to lowest of that sum, then you begin the first initiative pass. In an initiative pass, in order, each participant takes a turn if they have at least one turn remaining in their pool, then subtracts one turn from their pool. This continues until all participants have taken one turn, at which point the initiative pass ends. An Action Phase consists of repeated initiative passes until all actors are out of turns.

An Action Phase takes 6 seconds, and the maximum number of turns in any being's pool is universally five.

Initiative Types:
-----------------
There are four types of initiative, three which can all be occurring simultaneously and take roughly the same amount of time. These are Social, Physical, Astral, and Matrix Initiative. Social Initiative is the odd one out, as a Turn in Social Initiative takes one minute and follows somewhat different rules.

*Physical Initiative*:
Physical Initiative uses Agility and Intuition for its stat sum. It represents how fast you're moving in physical, normally combat situations where time is of the essence. A normal person has one turn in Physical Initiative: this may be modified by drugs, magic, and certain 'ware.

*Astral Initiative*:
Astral Initiative uses Logic and Intuition for its stat sum. Only purely Astral forms use Astral Initiative, as it represents the speed of your spirit.

*Matrix Initiative*:
Matrix Initiative uses Intuition and Data Processing for its stat sum. Only personas in VR use Matrix Initiative, because while the matrix moves at the speed of thought, peoples' fingers do not (normally).

*Social Initiative*:
Social Initiative uses Intuition and Charisma for its stat sum. Social Initiative can be used in place of any of the others when the physical, astral, or digital scenario is conversational instead of outright hostile. A Turn in Social Initiative takes one minute, and consists of vastly different actions and maneuvers.

Actions and Initiative:
-----------------------
During your turn, you may spend any amount of movement at any time between actions, for example, you may not continue moving in between firing your gun and resolving its damage, but you may move both before and after firing the gun. Keep in mind that your movement is per action phase, not per Turn. Over the course of your turn, you may take one complex action or two simple actions, as you choose. You may also take one free action during your turn.

Note that most actions are not limited to use in initiative. While initiative is necessary for conflict and can be appropriate for measuring time outside of combat (such as sneaking through a guarded facility on a timer), it is not necessary to perform any action unless otherwise stipulated. Mind, some actions (such as shooting potential combattants) may cause combat and initiative. In these instances, initiative begins after the action is complete.

Unusual Initiative:
-------------------
Interrupt Actions:
Sometimes, it is possible to act outside of your turn. In those instances, if you have a turn remaining in which you still have the action type listed remaining, you may take an interrupt action. Every interrupt action specifies what action type it consumes. On the interrupting character's next turn, they may only act as if they had already taken the interrupt action's action cost on that turn. For example, taking a simple interrupt means that on the character's next turn, they may only take one simple action. A character who has already taken a simple interrupt may not take a complex interrupt until after their turn.

Entering Initiative Late:
Sometimes, you show up to the scene fashionably... not-quite-on-time. In those circumstances, you generate your initiative as normal for the encounter, but reduce the number of turns you get in the first Action Phase in which you participate by the number of initiative passes already completed that Action Phase.
