Build Points
============
Build points (BP) are the measure of a character's progression and power, used to create a character and after character creation to advance a character. A standard character starts out with <#> BP to spend on various things. Many, many effects, traits, and qualities can be purchased with BP. In fact, anything that you can gain access to, in one way or another, has a cost in BP. Anything you can buy with BP will list its cost in some way or another.
Of note are the following special rules that regard BP:

* By working for the Man for one day, you may convert 1 BP to 2000 Marks, or by working for the People, you may reverse that conversion. You may do this instantaneously during character creation to purchase starting gear.
* You may not purchase submersion, optimization, or initiation grades during character creation, nor may you raise skills above rank 6 during character creation.
* During character creation, you can take up to negative qualities, gaining BP equal to their value up to a maximum of 25 BP gained.

Gaining BP:
-----------
Characters do not stay the same forever. They grow and change. This is represented by increase in build points. After most moonwalks, your GM will grant you a number of build points appropriate to the challenges faced, the growth undergone, and a bonus if the job helped make the world just a little bit brighter. Most moonwalks are also sponsored by Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith pays well, appropriately to the job, almost always in marks loaded onto a credstick, and Mr. Smith knows that moonwalkers occasionally have moral compasses, so when he's asking them to do something unusually cruel or evil, he pays extra. Normally.

Using BP:
=========
Characters may use Build Points directly to purchase a variety of changes to their character.

Quality Changes:
----------------

* Negative qualities taken or assigned by the GM can be removed at a cost equal to twice the base value of the negative quality.
* Positive qualities can be purchased at the base value of the positive quality, with the permission of the GM.
* Positive qualities can be removed at a cost equal to half the base value of the positive quality, with the permission of the GM.
* When negative qualities are assigned by the GM during play, the character gains a number of BP equal to the value of the negative quality.

Increasing attributes:
----------------------

* Physical and Mental attributes may be increased up to the racial or subracial maximum at a cost of 5 * the new rating in BP.
* Special attributes may be increased up to the appropriate maximum determined by the special attribute at a cost of 4 * the new rating in BP.

Increasing skills:
------------------

* Increasing skills costs a different amount of BP based on the rating being gained. An increase in rating costs New Rating * (New Rating / 4 rounded up) BP.
