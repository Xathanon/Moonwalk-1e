Build Points:
=============
Build points (BP) are the measure of a character's progression and power, used to create a character and after character creation to advance a character. A standard character starts out with <#> BP to spend on various things. Many, many effects, traits, and qualities can be purchased with BP. In fact, anything that you can gain access to, in one way or another, has a cost in BP. Anything you can buy with BP will list its cost in some way or another.
Of note are the following special rules that regard BP:
- By working for the Man for one day, you may convert 1 BP to 2000 Marks, or by working for the People, you may reverse that conversion. You may do this instantaneously during character creation to purchase your gear.
- You may not purchase submersion, optimization, or initiation grades during character creation, nor may you raise skills above rank 6 during character creation.

Gaining BP:
-----------
Characters do not stay the same forever. They grow and change. This is represented by increase in build points. After most moonwalks, your GM will grant you a number of build points appropriate to the challenges faced, the growth undergone, and a bonus if the job helped make the world just a little bit brighter. Most moonwalks are also sponsored by Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith pays well, appropriately to the job, almost always in marks loaded onto a credstick, and Mr. Smith knows that moonwalkers occasionally have moral compasses, so when he's asking them to do something unusually cruel or evil, he pays extra. Normally.
