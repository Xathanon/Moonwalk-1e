Movement:
=========
In a given Turn, a character has various amounts of movement, which they may use to move, depending on their mode of motion and their Agility.

Movement has two modes: a regular mode and a swift mode. Switching to swift mode is a free action that must be taken on one's action phase. One's speed in each movement type is determined by Agility times the movement multiplier for that type. If you switch to swift mode, you gain twice as much movement, but will be subject to Swift Movement modifiers. At the start of each Turn, you automatically return to regular mode until you use a free action to enter swift mode again.

The amount you have moved in a given Turn is taken out of all of your movement rates equally, and if you would be forced to use a movement type that you have no remaining movement in, you cannot move.

Sprinting:
----------
As a simple action, you can make a movement test. This is made with Strength + the appropriate movement skill (or Data Processing instead of Strength for Matrix Movement). Your hits are multiplied by the normal attribute, and that amount is added to your available movement for the Turn. You cannot take this action if the only movement type you may use is Crawling.

At the end of an Action Phase in which you sprint at least once, you must resist an amount of stun damage equal to the number of consecutive Action PHases in which you have used Sprint, using Fortitude + Willpower instead of Fortitude + Armor.

Swift Movement:
---------------
Swift Movement incurs the following effects:

* -2 penalty to all ranged attacks made against the character.
* -2 penalty to all actions taken by the character.
* Other instances recorded as regards the specific actions or options affected by them.
