Metarules
=============
Metarules are rules that apply to the reading and use of the rules themselves. These are important to understanding the intent of the rules, thus they are codified here so that the exact reading of the rules is exactly what is intended in their writing.

Specific Overrides
------------------
Whenever a general rule is applicable to an instance, and a specific rule is given, the specific rule overrides the general rule. If two mechanics seem to be in conflict, whichever one is more limited in scope (specific gun vs. all guns in general, for instance) is the prevalent rule.

Law of Omission
---------------
Whenever an exception is stated in one instance of a mechanic, whatever apparent negation there is to that exception is applicable in all other instances of that mechanic. For example, if a pistol says that it gives a -1 penalty to hearing shots fired, other pistols do not give such a penalty, unless otherwise specified.

Effect Stacking:
----------------
Various effects are named, such as programs and sustained spells. No named effect may simultaneously affect the same target (for example, two different mages casting Increase Reflexes on the same target) but instead use the most potent applicable instance of that effect (gaining the effects of the Increase Reflexes spell with the most hits in the prior example).

Rounding:
---------
Whenever it's necessary to round a number, which is quite often, you round up, no matter what the fraction is, if it is not an exact number.
