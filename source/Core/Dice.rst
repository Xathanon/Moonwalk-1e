Resolving Actions:
==================
The central mechanic of a roleplaying game is the method of resolving actions that have a chance of failure. In Moonwalk, this is called a "test," and has the following steps:
- Create a dicepool, a number of d6s, as designated by the action or your GM.
- Roll and count those dice. Once you've rolled the appropriate number of d6s, every die that comes up as a 5 or 6 is a 'hit.' 
- Check your limit, if there is one - you can only keep a number of hits up to the relevant limit.
- Count up how many 1s you rolled (see Glitches below).
- Finally, you compare the number of hits you have kept to the number of hits required to succeed, called the threshold.
This process is written in shorthand in the following method: Dicepool calculation [Limit] (Threshold)

Opposed Tests:
--------------
Sometimes, you will be opposing your actions directly against another being's attempt to resist. In that case, there is no threshold. Instead, the opposing party rolls a dice pool based on their stats, called a 'defense test.' In order to succeed, you must keep more hits than they rolled. If a tie is rolled, the defending side (meaning the side that did not initiate the action) wins.
These are written in shorthand in the following method: Dicepool calculation [Limit] vs. Dicepool calculation

Extended Tests:
---------------
Many tests are not one-off deals and require a lot more time and effort. Those actions require an extended test, which takes the form of several tests across intervals. You perform steps 1-5 as normal, then if you have not yet succeeded, you perform them again after subtracting one die from your dicepool and add up your hits across all the tests to compare with the threshold. Your limit applies only to each test individually - your total hits are added after the limit is applied to each test. Each test takes an amount of time called an "Interval."
Extended tests are written in shorthand in the following method: Dicepool calculation [Limit] (Threshold, Interval) Extended Test

Non-Standard Tests:
===================
Sometimes tests are very different, falling under a completely separate set of rules.

Trying Again:
-------------
Trying again is the joy of those who fail the first time. If what you are attempting is an opposed test, you may try again at your earliest convenience, assuming they haven't shot you back yet, at no penalty. However, for basic and extended tests, whenever you begin trying again within twice the amount of time it takes to make the test (or within two intervals for an extended test) you suffer a -2 penalty. This penalty is cumulative if you try within the same amount of time from the second attempt.

Standard Result:
----------------
Not always is it practical or necessary to roll a dicepool for certain actions. Under circumstances where one is not aware that one is making a test, or under circumstances where the task is being done in a routine manner, one may divide the dice pool by 4 and count that many hits towards a threshold. The GM has the ultimate say over what does and does not qualify for the Standard Result. The Standard Result should never be used in combat.

Unusual Effects:
================
In addition to the basic calculation for a dicepool, there are a few other concerns that are occasionally referenced in other rules.

Modifiers:
----------
Whenever a modifier applies to test, that means that the modifier's number is added to or subtracted from the dicepool for the test before dice are rolled. If a modifier would reduce the dicepool to 0 dice, the player must either find a way to get more dice (normally edge) or forego the test, automatically failing or not having the option to take the action resulting in that test. Positive modifiers are occasionally called bonuses, and negative ones are occasionally called penalties.

The Rule of Six:
----------------
Occasionally, an effect might specify that it applies the Rule of Six to a roll. When you make such a roll, for every 6 rolled, you may roll another d6 as if it were part of your original pool (including rolling another die if it is also a six).
