Channelers
==========
Channelers are people gifted with the power to channel magical energy around them into themselves. They gain a number of power points equal to their Somatesthesia attribute, which they may spend on special powers. Their Somatesthesia attribute starts at 1, and has a maximum equal to their Essence attribute.

Channelers may select a paradigm when they gain the Channeler quality, or they may choose to have no paradigm. If they have no paradigm, they do not gain any effects from it, resist Warp with Fortitude + Willpower, and treat no background counts as Aspected Domains towards their paradigm.

Powers
------
All powers have a power point cost. Passive powers are active by default, but may be deactivated in situations where they would be counterproductive using a free action (and reactivated with the same).

Powers that have ranges can effect any target within a range - provided that target fits the target criterion of the power. Finally, the power point cost determines how many power points a power costs.

If a power has multiple ranks, its cost is shown per rank. The maximum rank for any power with ranks is equal to the channelerâ€™s Somatesthesia attribute, unless the power states otherwise.

Ceremonies
----------
Channelers may participate in ceremonies only as additional batteries for magic: if a ceremony would target its participants, and the participants would need to make tests, a Channeler cannot act as a participant or make any of those tests. Nonetheless, they count as a participant for the purpose of meeting requirements, and suffer the same amount of Warp as the leader of the ceremony.
