Mages
=====
Mages are individuals who have the power to channel magic outside of their bodies, often at great expense to the integrity of their mind and body in the form of Warp. These are the people who sling spells, enchant runes, and otherwise bring magic into the common view. They are often ridiculed and hated for their status as cultural outsiders and weird powers, but nonetheless are necessary for protection against the newly-arrived things that go bump in the night.

Mages must select a :doc:`Paradigm <Paradigms>` that assists them in using their powers. This is selected when the Mage quality is gained and can only be changed during Ascension.
