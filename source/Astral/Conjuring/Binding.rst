Binding
=======
Binding is the act of more permanently tethering spirits and constructs to your power and essence. It is a complicated affair, requiring a great deal of time and concentration, but allows for more permanent usage. Spirits are not unviersally enthused about such servitude, but their allegiance can be bought, like everything else.

Binding a Spirit
----------------
Binding a spirit means tethering another sentient entity to your will. However, they enter this state willingly, provided the mage is not cruel to them and an appropriate offering is made. To bind a spirit, you must take the following steps.

* **Prepare the Nexus.** To bind a spirit, you must be at the focal point of your power. Your Nexus must have a greater or equal Force to the spirit you are binding.
* **Make the Offering.** At the beginning of the binding process, you must make an offering to the spirit. This consists of a number of reagents equal to the spirit's Force.
* **Perform the Rite.** To bind the spirit requires a number of hours equal to the spirit's Force, in which the mage performs no other actions, activites, or combat movement. If the spirit would normally cease owing you services during this time, it does not cease owing services during the time, but instead ceases owing services if the binding fails.
* **Bind the Spirit.** The actual binding of the spirit consists of a Potency + Binding [Astral] vs. Force x 3 opposed test. On a success, the spirit is bound.
* **Resist Warp.** The binder must resist Warp equal to twice the spirit's Force.

The Bound Spirit
----------------
The bound spirit can perform the following services, as the rules for summoned spirits:

* Unbound Service: Any service that a merely summoned spirit could perform.
* Aid Sorcery: The spirit takes a complex action, and the next spell you cast within the Action Phase of the category with which its spirit type is related to based on your tradition gains a positive modifier to its casting roll equal to the spirit's force.
* Aid Artifice: The spirit lends some of its energy to one of your creations. You gain a positive modifier equal to the spirit's force to your next Brewing or Runesmithing test to make a Brew or Rune of a spell in the category related to the type of the spirit based on your tradition, provided that test is made within 1 hour.
* Aid Study: The spirit grants you a positive modifier equal to its force to a learning test to learn a spell or rune of the category to which it is related by your tradition, OR the spirit teaches you a spell or rune in the category related to its type by your tradition.
* Spell Sustaining: The spirit sustains a spell for you for a number of Turns equal to its force. During this time, you do not take the -2 penalty for sustaining to your actions - it does.

You may have a number of spirits bound to you equal to your Potency at once, but you cannot have more than one bound spirit actively aiding you at once. A bound spirit, unlike a merely summoned one, does not lose its services when it returns to its metaplane or is at great distances. Instead, it may be dismissed to its metaplane and called back with a simple action that doesn't take a service. Bound spirits are also harder to exorcise, and add the binder's Potency to their resistance test against being exorcised.
