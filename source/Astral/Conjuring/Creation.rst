Creation
========
Creation is an esoteric skill, primarily used for astral combat and defense. Creation is used to build astral constructs and objects out of sheer mana and force of will. Maintaining such objects inflicts a sustaining penalty as if sustaining a sustained spell, for each construct being maintained. When the creator is no longer conscious, all their constructs cease to exist. All objects created in this way are purely astral forms; they are not physical objects. Objects created with this skill cannot benefit from wireless functions. However, purely physical objects do not require deep knowledge of them to create, but rather rely on the character's ability to focus on the concept - hence being its own skill.

Creation is subdivided into three categories; the creation of weapons, the creation of armor, and the creation of objects. Each has a separate procedure, but all take a complex action.

Creating Weapons
----------------
Creating a weapon uses the steps below. An astral weapon created this way appears in the hands of its creator, and ceases to exist if it is no longer being held by an [Astral Essence].

* **Declare Force.** The mage must declare the Force of the construct.
* **Declare Type.** The mage must declare what melee weapon skill the construct will use when it is complete. 
* **Create Object.** The mage rolls Potency + Creation [Force] to create the object. The hits achieved are used in the final effects of the weapon.
* **Resist Warp.** The mage must resist Warp equal to the Force of the construct.

The finished weapon, when wielded in astral combat, has Accuracy equal to its Force and deals damage equal to the wielder's Charisma + the hits achieved on the Creation test.

Creating Armor
--------------
Creating armor uses the following steps:

* **Declare Force.** The mage must declare the Force of the construct.
* **Create Object.** The mage rolls Potency + Creation [Force] to create the armor. The hits achieved are used in the final calculations of the armor.
* **Resist Warp.** The mage must resist Warp equal to the Force of the construct.

The finished armor, when worn in astral combat, provides an armor rating against astral attacks equal to its Force + the hits on the Creation test.

Creating Objects
----------------
Creating objects takes a complex action. You cannot create an object that does not fit in a cube such that one side has a length in meters equal to your Potency.

* **Declare Force.** The mage must declare the Force of the construct.
* **Create Object.** The mage rolls Potency + Creation [Force] to create the object.
* **Resist Warp.** The mage must resist Warp equal to the Force of the construct.

The finished object, whatever it is, uses the hits on the Creation test to determine its Rating. What that rating is relevant to is between you and the GM.

Constructs and Damage
---------------------
All constructs are treated as barriers, but having a stun condition monitor in place of a physical condition monitor. If their condition monitor is filled, they cease to exist. They have a Structure Rating and equal to their Force, for the purposes of resisting astral damage and calculating their condition monitor. If an effect targeting a construct would be resisted by Willpower, it is instead resisted by Structure.
