Arcane Channelers
=================
Arcane Channelers are exceptionally few gifted individuals who manifest both the powers of a channeler and a mage in roughly equal part. An arcane channeler has both a Somatesthesia attribute, which starts at 1 and has a maximum of the character's Essence, and a Potency attribute, which has the same starting and maximum value. Arcane channelers do not innately have astral perception or projection capabilities, but may purchase the Astral Perception power as usual for a channeler.

Any mechanic that references "Potency or Somatesthesia" uses the higher of the two for an Arcane Channeler. This does not apply to any mechanics that list one or the other, but rather applies only to mechanics that specify that one uses one's potency or somatesthesia as one has them (such as Astral Intersection).
