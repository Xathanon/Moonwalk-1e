Paradigms
=========
A paradigm is a means by which a mage, channeler, or arcane channeler perceives their powers, so that they can handle the astral energies. Each paradigm has a tradition attribute, which determines how mages and arcane channelers of that tradition resist Warp from magical activities. In addition, each paradigm has a set of four spirits, which determine which spirits may be summoned by mages and arcane channelers of that paradigm. Each spirit type is associated with a specific category of spell (combat, detection, illusion, kinesis, or psionic), leaving one category devoid of spiritual assistance. This spell category is known as a Paradigm's 'weakness,' and is marked as such. Some paradigms also have special rules based on their perception of the world. Once a paradigm has been selected, it can only be changed upon achieving Ascension. Once it is changed in this way, it cannot be changed again until the character's Ascension Degree is becoming twice what it became the last time they changed paradigms.

A few paradigms are listed as possession paradigms; this means that any spirits that they summon normally have the Possession power instead of Materialization. This does not include spirits summoned forth by ceremonies or other means than the Summon astral action.

Paradigms are listed in the following format:

Name (tradition attribute)
--------------------------
Special Rules (if present)

* Combat: <spirit type>
* Detection: <spirit type>
* Illusion: <spirit type>
* Kinesis: <spirit type>
* Psionic: <spirit type>

Description

Hermeticism (Logic)
-------------------

* Combat: Fire
* Detection: Water
* Illusion: Air
* Kinesis: Earth
* Psionic: Weakness

Hermeticism is both an old and a new paradigm. Handed down by magi of old, it is the art of scientifically inducing and deducing the effects and capabilities of magic. Hermetics have created most of the world's academies and libraries where magic is studied, and are the most wide-spread paradigm there is.


Hinduism (Logic)
----------------

* Combat: Weakness
* Detection: Water
* Illusion: Air
* Kinesis: Task
* Psionic: Fire

Hinduism is based on an ancient religious system, mostly focused on transcendence and enlightenment. While it has become distinctly less common with the destruction of most of India, the Taj Mahal still stands and has been converted into an academy by one of the most powerful remaining enclaves of Hindu Awakened. Hindu practitioners often use mantras and bhajan to help them focus their energies, as well as surprising amounts of dance in rituals and ceremonies.

Islamic (Logic)
---------------
Islamic mages cannot use Summoning or Binding without permission from a religious authority. They gain the Advanced Brewing quality for free.

* Combat: Earth
* Detection: Fire
* Illusion: Weakness
* Kinesis: Water
* Psionic: Air

Islamic mages are those who use the Quran as their inspiration and instruction, often using phylacteries containing parts of it as talismans. They are nonetheless bound by the hefty restrictions against summoning or binding the djinni, due to the inherent danger of doing so.

Norse (Logic)
-------------
Norse mages cannot use the Binding skill, nor can they use Exorcism. However, they gain the Expert Runesmith quality for free.

* Combat: Guardian
* Detection: Guidance
* Illusion: Beast
* Kinesis: Air
* Psionic: Weakness

Norse magic is truly old, and while the magic of Elder Futhark has only recently returned, some ancient runes found on the scandanavian peninsula, with the return of magic, returned to being active, to various odd effects.

Planar Magic (Logic)
--------------------
Planar Mages gain the Guiding Spirit quality for free. In order to Ascend for the first time, they must have made contact with a free spirit, even if that contact did not result in a pact.

* Combat: Guardian
* Detection: Guidance
* Illusion: Humanity
* Kinesis: Weakness
* Psionic: Task

Planar Mages are mages who believe that all magic comes forth from the astral sea, and place great importance on spirits pacts, summoning, binding, and other arts related thereto. Some of them are even cultists dedicated to mighty spirits they have encountered out in the metaplanes - these ones can be quite dangerous. No matter the principles at hand, Planar Mages always have a Guiding Spirit that they follow.

Qabbalism (Logic)
-----------------
Qabbalism is a possession paradigm.

* Combat: Air
* Detection: Weakness
* Illusion: Water
* Kinesis: Task
* Psionic: Earth

Qabbalists are those who follow ancient Hebrew writings, including the Torah but more notably the Zohar, SeferYetzirah, and Bahar, as well as other works from that time. Most practitioners of this paradigm are mages, and use the Hebrew alphabet and complex numerological and astrological charts to discover and utilize the Names of things, which hold tremendous significance to a practitioner.

Chaos Magic (Intuition)
-----------------------
Upon choosing or changing to the chaos magic paradigm, choose one category to be a weakness, then assign the following spirit types to each of the other categories as you choose: earth, air, fire, and guardian. Chaos mages may not take the Guiding Spirit quality.

* Combat: See Special Rules
* Detection: See Special Rules
* Illusion: See Special Rules
* Kinesis: See Special Rules
* Psionic: See Special Rules

Chaos Magic is all about using whatever works. Chaos mages use any combination of anything from any paradigm, and are often unrecognizable to anyone else, including others who in theory share their paradigm - any two practitioners may be practicing it in a vastly different way.

Druidry (Intuition)
-------------------

* Combat: Beast
* Detection: Weakness
* Illusion: Fire
* Kinesis: Plant
* Psionic: Air

Druidic magic is about connecting to the land in which you live. Druids often focus on summoning spirits local to the area, including free and wild spirits, to aid them, and building positive relationships with those spirits by holistic lifestyles and defending their territory from pollution. This eco-friendly view tints their entire perspective, but is most focused wherever they believe their particular territory is. Many practitioners of druidic magic refer back to ancient Celtic practices as the root of their paradigm.

Tir’an Elv’hanan (Intuition)
----------------------------
Practitioners of the Tir’an Elv’hanan, which translates to ‘the ways of the elven lands,’ cannot use the Binding skill, and gain the Wanted quality for free. They do not, however, have a weakness category of spells. This paradigm can only be practiced by elves.

* Combat: Beast
* Detection: Air
* Illusion: Guidance
* Kinesis: Plant
* Psionic: Fire

Tir’an Elv’hanan, the way of the elven lands, is a complex and confusing paradigm claimed by the Tuatha leaders of Elvhanan to be at least as old as the second cycle - possibly older. Whatever secrets are on their fog-shrouded island about it, however, stay there - practicing this paradigm away from the island, and away from the authority of the Tuatha, means being hunted for your entire life. Teaching a non-elf even the basics of the paradigm is antithetical to its worldview, and because of the restrictions, even among elves, it is incredibly rare away from Elvhanan.

Totemic Magic (Intuition)
-------------------------

* Combat: Beast
* Detection: Air
* Illusion: Weakness
* Kinesis: Earth
* Psionic: Guardian

Awakened who follow totem magic never call it that - shamans from the northwestern America, aboriginals holding out in Australia, all have their own terms for it. Either way, it consists of a respect for nature hard to find elsewhere, and adherence to ideals associated with a specific animal, known as their totem, which almost all practitioners of the paradigm have. Most practitioners have a Guiding Spirit which provides them with instruction on the functions of their paradigm.

Witchcraft (Intuition)
----------------------

* Combat: Weakness
* Detection: Fire
* Illusion: Guidance
* Kinesis: Humanity
* Psionic: Plant

Witches, as they’re known, rose to prominence in the wake of World War III in a network of covens that still persist. Witchcraft, far from being exclusively the art of summoning and making deals with the devil, is taken to be a far more holistic approach to magic. It’s a common philosophy among practitioners of witchcraft that you should tend your own garden and it will tend to you. The basis of witchcraft is often referenced as being the extension of the early 21st century rise of the practice of Wicca and other forms of neo-paganism. Old-school paganism is handled in its own paradigms.

Wuxing (Intuition)
------------------
* Combat: Air
* Detection: Guidance
* Illusion: Water
* Kinesis: Fire
* Psionic: Weakness

Wuxing is an ancient Chinese tradition of manipulating feng shui and environmental energies to align with one's spirit. It also has significant astrological and elemental teachings, which make it highly conducive to the summoning of elemental spirits.

Black Magic (Charisma)
----------------------

* Combat: Humanity
* Detection: Water
* Illusion: Guidance
* Kinesis: Plant
* Psionics: Air

Practitioners of the Black Magic paradigm are out for themselves - and not in a simple, 'edgy' way. They seek the deep pleasure not just of getting what they want, but of having other people gather to beg to give it to them. Above all else, they desire power - and they achieve that power through manipulation, though brute force is always a tool in their kits. This often occurs by use of the 'darkness' symbols in other paradigms to manipulate others, so black magic is often called different things depending on where a practitioner is from.

Christian Theurgy (Charisma)
----------------------------
Christian Theurgy has not one, but two spell categories that are Weaknesses, as shown above. Christian Theurgists also cannot use the Binding skill. However, they gain a +2 bonus to all tests using Abjuration skills, and a +2 bonus to all tests using Invocation and Evocation.

* Combat: Air
* Detection: Guidance
* Illusion: Weakness
* Kinesis: Water
* Psionics: Weakness

Christian Theurges are from all walks of life and branches of the faith, from Evangelists to even a few Catholics (though, due to the Encyclical Magicae Dei most Catholic Awakened follow a Hermetic paradigm). They tend to be pacifistic and unsure of how to deal with spirits - and the jury's still out on whether spirits are really demons.

Egyptian (Charisma)
-------------------
Egyptian magic is a possession paradigm.

* Combat: Fire
* Detection: Weakness
* Illusion: Guidance
* Kinesis: Humanity
* Psionics: Water

Egyptian magic has made a massive resurgence due to the rise of Isis Industries. Most practitioners are II-sponsored local talismongers who sell the latest and greatest in magic, imported from Cairo. Hieroglyphic inscriptions and manifestations are common signs of the use of this tradition, and their spirits often take the form of the Glorious Ones - gods and pharoahs who have ascended to join them. While none of the modern pharoahs of Egypt have been seen in the form of spirits yet, some at Isis Industries only believe it's a matter of time before a new Ramses ascends.

Latreklesis (Charisma)
----------------------

* Combat: Humanity
* Detection: Task
* Illusion: Air
* Kinesis: Weakness
* Psionics: Fire

Latreklesis is a paradigm that focuses intently and intimately on the practitioner and their mental state. Practitioners of Latreklesis believe that all of magic is simply a mental construct by which the strong-minded exert their will over reality more directly and control the weak - they believe that all other paradigms are simply practitioners lying to themselves, moralizing and justifying their powers because they are not strong enough to accept the truth.

Shinto (Charisma)
-----------------

* Combat: Weakness
* Detection: Fire
* Illusion: Beasts
* Kinesis: Fire
* Psionics: Humanity

Shinto, being the official religion of Japan, is widely practiced throughout Teikoku Investments employees and subsidiaries, with respect for the Kami being the primary basis of the religion. Spirits are widely considered to be the Kami of various aspects of reality, and Shinto had probably the least problematic adjustment to the return of magic of any major religion.

Dark Magic
==========
The following three paradigms are not for use by player characters who have any sanity. We invite the players to not use these paradigms, under any circumstances, unless the GM expressly offers it to them. Bear in mind even in those rare cases that they are likely to cost the character their sanity, their life, and likely, their ability to function as a player's character, slowly becoming an NPC.

Spider Magic (Intuition)
------------------------
Spider magic can only be practiced by mages who have become captured in the metaplanes by a true spider spirit. Spider magic does not have a weakness category.

* Combat: Scorpion (Beast)
* Detection: Araneae (Water)
* Illusion: Acariformes (Air)
* Kinesis: Opiliones (Guardian)
* Psionic: Vinegaroons (Fire)

Spider magic isn't just spiders. It's all sorts of nasty arachnids that are trying to cover this planet in webs. Spider mages are those poor fools who have been taken into the metaplanar webs of the spiders' plane of existence and sent back out with a mental parasite that controls their actions, driving them to insane ceremonies and sacrifices that attempt to bring forth a true spider spirit into the world - not just the lesser aspects they conjure at the tip of a hat. True spider spirits are solitary, terrifying creatures that create Astral Webs and have been responsible for horrible things. Spider magic rarely sees long-term use as upon conclusion of such a summoning, the practitioner is normally consumed whole by the fledgling spirit. Spider mages fight and act with reckless abandon, their lives being meaningless and controlled towards the end of summoning their own destruction. They are also hunted down with extreme prejudice by those Awakened and Mundane who have any sanity remaining.


Tzaka-Isskarazh (Potency)
-------------------------
Only dragons can practice Tzaka-Isskarazah. Practitioners of Tzaka-Isskarazh may summon any normal spirit type, and have no weakness in spell categories. They resist Warp with Willpower + Fortitude + Potency. Practitioners also treat all positive background counts as an aspected domain towards their paradigm, including aspected domains towards other paradigms. However, double the effective rating of a negative background count when calculating its effect on a practitioner of this paradigm.

* Combat: Special
* Detection: Special
* Illusion: Special
* Kinesis: Special
* Psionic: Special

Tzaka-Isskarazh is the paradigm utilized by dragons, and only dragons. No details about it have ever been shared besides its name - including even the translation of its name. Observation of dragons reveals that it, to put simply, breaks the rules of paradigms practiced by human and extrahuman mages, robustly and completely. Whatever means the dragons use to practice it is available only to them, however, and they do not share it. Keeper Ildranath gave comment on this observation by saying simply that no human or extrahuman could handle the principles of dragon magic save perhaps a drake, and even such would be at great risk.

Void Magic (Fortitude)
----------------------
Wielders of Void Magic cannot use Summoning, as no spirit would hear their call. No practitioner of any other paradigm may use any talisman they create, nor may they use talismans created by practitioners of other paradigms. A practitioner of Void Magic treats all negative background counts as if they were positive aspected domains towards their paradigm - and whenever the use of Void Magic would create or increase a background count, it instead reduces the background count value, potentially putting it into a negative value. Practitioners of Void Magic cannot deal normal elemental effects, but all of their damaging spells and magical effects count as dealing Void damage - including Warp they suffer. Practitioners of Void Magic also have no spell category weakness.

* Combat: None
* Detection: None
* Illusion: None
* Kinesis: None
* Psionic: None

Void Magic is a paradigm constantly hunted and exterminated by all dragons. Corporations, however, have occasionally found uses for Void Magic, when the practitioners are sane enough to follow orders. The alien powers that define the paradigm make a void mage's powers manifest as a lack of energy, as opposed to positive energy, draining away emotions and life from their victims as they are slowly destroyed. As such the emotions of the void mage are unimportant, giving way to the necessity of physical durability to survive the utter lack of energy brought on by the use of void magic.
