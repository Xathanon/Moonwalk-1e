Advanced Artifice
=================
Artifice is the second-most respected of the High Arts, since at least most people can use the products of an artificer's work. Artificers are often respected craftsmen and scientists in their communities, easing their relationships with those who suspect sorcery of devilcraft and evil murder rituals of any hint of abnormal behavior.

Improved Triggers (Mage)
------------------------
This metamagic allows the runesmith to create runes with more sophisticated triggers. All of these triggers add an additional +2 Warp beyond that of their base triggers.

* Advanced Command: The creator of the rune may activate the rune at any distance as a simple action, regardless of line of sight. If the runesmith does not have line of sight to the rune, they cannot choose the target and (if applicable) it defaults to the nearest valid target.
* Advanced Contact: At the time of the rune's creation, the runesmith may specify a specific target to whom he has a Link. Only that target may trigger the rune. Alternatively, the runesmith may select a race that may trigger the rune.
* Advanced Destruction: The rune triggers when *any* effect would cause the rune to be destroyed, regardless of the state of the object. This includes the destruction of the object, but also if the rune would be disjoined, or if a background count would remove the rune. If a spell with this trigger requires the target, it targets the nearest valid target.

Flexible Brews (Mage)
---------------------
The art of brewing becomes yet more potent as one is able to modify the vectors which brews use. A mage with the Flexible Brews metamagic may adjust the vectors of his brews; any Contact vector brew may have the Inhalation vector added to it, and any Ingestion vector brew may have the Injection vector added to it. These new vectors can be in addition to or replacing the base vector of the brew.

Adjusting the vector of a brew in this way adds +2 Warp to be resisted during the Resist Warp step of brewing.
