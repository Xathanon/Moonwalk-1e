Subtle Mana
===========
Everyone loves flying under the radar in the underworld, and in social situations it can be quite awkward to have obvious mojo going - let alone that it makes you the obvious target for killing first above all else because of how dangerous magic can be on the battlefield. While those who claim to have "style" dislike this Art, they tend to have short lifespans.

Flexible Signature (Mage)
-------------------------
When a mage with flexible signature leaves an astral signature for any reason, they may choose to place their astral signature in a state of flux. The threshold for finding any information about the signature is increased by the mage's Ascension degree.

Numinous Suppression (Mage)
---------------------------
While most magic causes unnatural reactions in animals and humans alike, a mage with numinous suppression can cast spells without even disturbing a mouse. The threshold for numinous perception on such a mage's use of abilities is increased by their Ascension degree.

Stillness of the Void (Channeler)
---------------------------------
While the technique's name reeks of Void Magic, it actually has absolutely nothing to do with that paradigm. This ability allows the channeler to actively resist being detected by detection divinations. Any such spell gets only information about the channeler as if the number of hits scored by the caster were reduced by the channeler's Ascension degree - and with 0 hits, the channeler is entirely undetected.

Astral Shadow (Channeler)
-------------------------
This ability allows a channeler to sneak through even the most conniving wards. Whenever the channeler's aura would set off a triggered magical effect of any sort, they may make a Somatesthesia + Willpower [Ascension degree] (Force of the effect) test. On a success, the effect doesn't go off. Examples include contact brews and runes, for starters.
