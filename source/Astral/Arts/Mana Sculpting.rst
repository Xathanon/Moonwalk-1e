Mana Sculpting
==============
Mana sculpting is an esoteric art produced by Channelers, for Channelers, to deal with Channeler powers. It grants them great versatility where they were deeply lacking. With appropriate study and meditation in this Art, Channelers learn to respecialize and change the powers they have access to, temporarily or even permanently.

Power Swap (Channeler)
----------------------
With lengthy meditation, a channeler may use this metamagic to permanently change what powers he has. This requires a Somatesthesia + Arcana [Astral] (8 x number of power points to be changed, one day) extended test. On completion, the channeler may change what power points are allocated where, up to the amount specified. A power cannot be partially reallocated, but individual ranks of them may be.

Energy Sculpt (Channeler)
-------------------------
A more temporary solution to versatility issues, Energy Sculpt allows a channeler to momentarily boost some powers at the extent of others. As a complex action (this is an astral action), the channeler may make a Somatesthesia + Willpower [Ascension degree] test. For each hit he scores, he may lower the level of one power and consequently raise the level of another that costs the same amount or less per level as the one lowered. This lasts for a number of Action Phases equal to the channeler's Ascension degree, at the end of which the Channeler takes an amount of Warp equal to the amount of levels of powers he displaced.
