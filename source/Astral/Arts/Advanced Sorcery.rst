Advanced Sorcery
================
Sorcery is at least comprehensible to most people - the mage waves their hands at you, and something spooky happens. They're terrified of it, of course, but that's normal for mages. Advanced sorcery isn't respected, but rather feared, since those who specialize deeply have great power at their fingertips whenever they call upon it.

Spell Shaping (Mage)
--------------------
A sorcerer who has mastered spell shaping can weave their spells around their allies without doing the faintest trace of harm. Whenever a mage with this metamagic casts a spell with the Area tag, they may designate a number of targets of the spell to suffer no effects, as if they weren't within the area of the spell at all, up to the caster's degree of Ascension.

Dispersion (Mage)
-----------------
Instead of suffering the normal effects of failed rituals and ceremonies, you have focused on stabilizing your rituals. When you invoke a ritual or evoke a ceremony, you may decrease the number of hits it gets by your degree of Ascension when calculating results. However, you still suffer Warp from the full hits of the activity.
