Beast Speaking
==============
Favored of animal shamans, snake charmers, and beast handlers the world over, beast speaking is a useful, if underappreciated art that taps into the universal nature of mana as a medium of emotions for communication and control of less emotionally powerful creatures. While it has a complex relationship with psionic spells, beast speaking is said to be more 'primordial' than manipulating others' minds.

Beast Speaker (Mage)
--------------------
Mages with this metamagic can 'speak' with beasts, be they mundane or Awakened - or even Emerged. This does not allow for the communication of complex concepts, as animals cannot comprehend such, but does allow the mage to communicate simplistic ideas such as territory, food, mating, and warning. This requires the mage to take a complex action to enter the appropriate state of mind to communicate with a given creature, which they can maintain for a number of minutes up to their Ascension degree. Note that while this does not improve the critter's attitude towards them, it grants a bonus equal to their Ascension degree to all uses of social skills and animal handling to interact with the creature.

Living Focus (Mage)
-------------------
Prerequisite: Beast Speaker
A mage who has mastered this power can hand off a spell to a willing animal that they have connected to with the Beast Speaker metamagic. The creature then sustains the spell for them, and the mage no longer suffers the -2 penalty for sustaining the spell. The creature needn't be Awakened to do this, but it will likely need to be bribed or trained in some way to appropriately handle the spell. The creature suffers the -2 penalty for sustaining a spell for as long as the mage sustains it, up to a maximum of the creature's Willpower in minutes, then either ends or returns to the mage (mage's choice at the time of handing off the spell).

Beast Familiar (Channeler)
--------------------------
Channelers do not make the same wide-ranging connections as mages - instead, they normally create a bond with one specific type of beast. Upon selecting this metamagic, choose a non-Awakened, non-sapient species. By making a Somatesthesia + Animal Handling [Astral] (Creature's Willpower squared, one hour) extended test, you may form a bond with any member of that creature's species. If the specific target has been genetically modified, you suffer a -4 penalty on this test, and if it has any 'ware, you suffer a -2 penalty - these are cumulative if both apply. On a success, you gain the ability to begin sensing through its senses as a simple action, which you may maintain for up to your Ascension degree in Turns. In addition, the creature obeys your commands without any need for any further Animal Handling tests.

Power Share (Channeler)
-----------------------
Prerequisite: Beast Familiar
A Channeler who has a beast familiar may use this technique to empower the familiar to fight alongside him. As a simple action (this is an astral action), he may select powers he has with a total power point value less than or equal to half his Ascension degree. For his Ascension degree in Turns, the beast gains the benefits of those powers. At the end of that period, both the channeler and the beast must resist Warp equal to the total power point value of the shared powers (the beast resists Warp with the same attributes the Channeler does).
