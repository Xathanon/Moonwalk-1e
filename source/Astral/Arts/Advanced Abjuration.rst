Advanced Abjuration
===================
Abjuration is the first and most respected of the High Arts, which are available only to mages, because it prevents other magic-users from screwing things up. People feel more secure around abjurers, and for good reason - it's a lot easier to relax when you know that some other mage's fireballs will have a much harder time getting to you.

Absorption (Mage)
-----------------
Mages who understand absorption are able to repurpose the energies they disjoin. Whenever a test with an Abjuration skill that is not Reflection or part of a ceremony is successful, the mage gains Absorption points equal to the Force of the effect being targeted (spell for Negation, etc.). A mage may have a maximum number of Absorption points equal to their degree of Ascension - any excess absorption points are lost. The mage may expend Absorption points as if they were using Blood Magic Points at a rate of one effective BMP per two absorption points.

Reflection (Mage)
-----------------
The mage who has mastered reflection is the bane of spellcasters. Whenever a spell is cast or a rune is activated within your line of sight, physical line of sight for terrestrial spells and astral for astral spells, you may take a complex interrupt (this is an astral action) to attempt to reflect the spell back at the caster or runed object. The casting test becomes opposed against your Negation + Potency test. If they succeed, the spell is cast as normal, with their net hits counting as hits on the casting test. If you succeed, the spell is reflected; you may choose new targets for the spell as if you had cast it, and your net hits are treated as hits on the casting test. If neither side scores any net hits, the spell fizzles out harmlessly.
