Sympathetic Magic
=================
Masters of sympathetic magic use Links gratuitously, since at their hands, such connections are far easier to use. Voudounists are often quite fond of this technique, and in the rise of Isis Industries, sympathetic magic is used for the execration of major criminals (including many Moonwalkers).

Symbolic Linking (Mage)
-----------------------
A mage who understands symbolic linking is a master of sympathetic magic, and one to be greatly feared. Normally they are feared, as the owners of strange, eerie dolls, masks, figurines, portraits, and other representations of people. By making a Potency + <Any Artistic Skill> (Target's Willpower, one hour) extended test, the mage may make a symbolic link to any person whom they have scored at least four net hits on assensing. This symbolic link may be used in place of a Link for any act of magic that requires a Link, but inflicts a -4 penalty on any tests made for acts that rely on such a Link. A symbolic link, like a sympathetic link, can't be used for any magical activities that do not require a Link at all.

Mystic Restraints (Mage)
------------------------
Using this technique, a mage may bind his victims' auras, preventing them from using magic effectively, in the use of keyed physical restraints. By using a Link while crafting a normal restraint (see Crafting), a mage with this metamagic may create a mystic restraint. Such restraints prevent the person to whom the Link belongs from performing any magical activities for as long as they are wearing the restraints.
