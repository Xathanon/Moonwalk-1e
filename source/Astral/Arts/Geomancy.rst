Geomancy
========
Geomancy is the study of mana lines, background counts, astral phenomena, and manipulating them. Geomancy has a strong fastness in east asian cultures, where feng shui has become a literal science, and in more natural paradigms that view the land as sacred. Hermetics practice it mostly as a means to directly add to their power, creating local background counts and aspected domains. For channelers, this also includes understanding the mana flow throughout their bodies and those of their enemies.

Ley Sense (Mage)
----------------
A mage who has reached into the heart of geomancy learns many rituals, but all rely on knowing the astral world around them intimately. Such a mage is always aware of the exact background count around them, the presence or absence of ley lines of any type, and on assensing a location successfully immediately knows if it is an aspected domain and if so to which paradigm (provided they know the paradigm), as well as knowing any astral phenomena currently occurring in the location or that have occurred in the location recently (within a number of days equal to their Ascension degree).

Recharge Reagents (Mage)
------------------------
Enhanced understanding of how magic flows through places and objects allows the mage to return excess magic from their own activities to nearby objects. When a mage with this metamagic expends the magic of one or more reagents on an activity, they may take additional Warp up to their Ascension degree to make that many reagents regain their magic after the activity is complete. This cannot regenerate more reagents than half of those expended on the activity.

Mana Choke (Channeler)
----------------------
By manipulating their own astral energies, a channeler with this metamagic can attempt to overpower their target's magic and temporarily prevent them from wielding it. Upon the completion of a melee attack with a telesmic weapon or unarmed strike, the channeler may make a Somatesthesia + Willpower [Ascension degree] vs. (Somatesthesia or Potency) + Willpower opposed test. The channeler's net hits are inflicted as a personalized negative background count local to the target's aura and hindering only their actions, which affects them for a number of Turns equal to the channeler's Ascension degree.

When this ability is activated, the channeler suffers Warp equal to the target's hits (not net hits) on the opposed test.

Mana Tap (Channeler)
--------------------
A channeler who has learned to tap into local mana is a terrifying beast. They may use a complex action (this is an astral action) while in a positive background count to absorb the excess energy. This temporarily reduces the effective rating of the background count for them (and only them) by their hits on a Somatesthesia + Willpower [Ascension degree] test to a minimum of 0, and temporarily grants one power point worth of powers per two points of reduced background count. This lasts for a number of action phases equal to the channeler's initiate grade, after which the channeler loses the temporary power points, is once again fully affected by the background count, and suffers from Warp equal to twice the power points gained.
