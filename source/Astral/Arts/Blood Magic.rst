Blood Magic
===========
While any mage may use blood magic, only those few who depend on it regularly specialize in its use to the extent to call it an art. These few share little of their arts, but the effects may be inferred.

Essence Tap (Mage)
------------------
While normal blood magic taps into the suffering of the target, an Essence Tap drains their soul out with their blood. Over the course of a minute, the user of this technique may make a Potency + Ascension degree [Astral] vs. Fortitude + Willpower test against an unwilling target, or no test against a willing target, to extract a piece of their soul. The target loses one point of essence, and the user gains one Soul Point.

Soul Points are like BMP, but more powerful: they fade after one minute (in or out of combat) unless an activity has begun that utilizes them. Using a Soul Point can achieve any of the effects of BMP, as if using five BMP, or may replace all reagents for any activity that would require reagents. In addition, any use of Soul Points on a magical activity removes all limits involved.

Blood Channel (Channeler)
-------------------------
Blood Channeling is a rare technique, but grants a greater versatility of power. As a free action, a channeler may use BMP to temporarily gain a new power (at rank 1, if applicable) with a power point cost equal to half the BMP expended. These powers last for a number of Action Phases equal to the channeler's Somatesthesia, and may be increased in rank by the normal use of BMP.

Blood Pool (Mage and Channeler)
-------------------------------
Normally, BMP fade away quickly. However, with the use of a Blood Pool, the blood magic user may retain an amount of BMP equal to their Ascension degree indefinitely. Any excess of this amount fades as normal for BMP.
