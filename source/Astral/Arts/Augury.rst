Augury
======
Augury manifests as the ability to see the past and future - mages learn rituals to predict the future and see the past of anything they touch, and channelers become aware of how their enemies will strike before the enemies themselves are. Hermetics theorize that the efficacy of Augury as an art is due to the four-dimensional nature of the gaiasphere - who can really be sure. Either way, in most places it's not permitted to arrest people for crimes they have been foreseen to commit, but increased surveillance is a matter of fact.

Sortilege (Mage)
----------------
Sortilege is the art of interpreting one's understanding of the future. The user of this metamagic makes an Intuition + Arcana [Ascension degree] (one hour) extended test. This test has no formal threshold; instead, the user gains knowledge about their future or the future of an object, location, or creature to which they have a Link appropriate to a focused divination with hits equal to one third of their hits on the extended test.

Psychometry (Mage)
------------------
Anyone who likes being cryptic can say, "to understand the future you must know the past", but mages who have learned this metamagic understand it. With a touch and a complex action, any mage with this metamagic may make an Intuition + Assensing [Ascension degree] test, gaining insight into the emotional significance of the object's past appropriate to a focused divination with hits equal to their hits on the psychometry test.

Danger Sense (Channeler)
------------------------
A channeler with this power is uncannily difficult to surprise. Whenever they would be surprised or treated as Unaware of an attacker, they may make a Grit + Ascension degree (3) test. On a success, they are not surprised or treated as unaware of any creatures currently involved in the combat.

Warding Visions (Channeler)
---------------------------
More than just sensing general danger, warnings of future injury are specific and often take the form of visions mid-battle. Once per Turn, as a complex action, the adept can make an Intuition + Ascension degree test, for which each hit grants a bonus to all dodge tests made for the rest of the Turn.
