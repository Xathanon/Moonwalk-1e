Advanced Conjuration
====================
Conjuration has always been stigmatized or at least abnormal, in every culture. In the Third Cycle, it's no different; a mage who hurls around spells or runes at least has a known repertoire, but spirits are capable of anything - and that's exactly what people are afraid of.

Great Form Conjuration (Mage)
-----------------------------
When a mage with this metamagic chooses to summon a spirit, they may attempt to summon a great form spirit instead. Great form spirits may not be bound, and resist being summoned with Force x 3 instead of Force x 2. Warp taken from summoning great form spirits is doubled.

Each type of spirit that can be normally summoned has a great form power, which it gains access to if it is summoned as a great form spirit. Upon using a great form power, a spirit ceases to owe any remaining services to its summoner.

Soul Network (Mage)
-------------------
One of the most feared techniques, this metamagic allows the conjurer to have multiple bound spirits serving them simultaneously, up to a maximum up to his degree of Ascension. The conjurer may issue commands to all such spirits with the same simple action.
