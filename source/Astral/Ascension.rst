Ascension, Arts, and Metamagic
==============================
Ascension is the process of deepening one's connection with magic and gaining access to unique new abilities. This is measured in degrees, which begin with an effective grade of 0, and increases by one each time the awakened ascends. This deepend connection requires the expenditure of 10 + (3 * new Ascension degree) BP, and a (Potency or Somatesthesia) + Willpower [Astral] (new Ascension degree, one week) extended test.

Most ascensions happen within arts, which often come with courses of study and degrees at hermetic academies, ranks in various religious hierarchies, or a simple sense of confidence for other paradigms. Each Art has a list of metamagics for channelers and a list of metamagics for mages. Arcane channelers must take all metamagics for a given Art before they may move on; a mage or channeler needs (and can) only take all the metamagics for their type before they move on to another Art. A given metamagic may be on both lists, but this results in no change for anyone.

There are five metamagics that do not belong to any art:

Channeler: Masking, Power Point, Mantra

Mage: Masking, Astralnaut, Chant

These metamagics are not subject to any of the restrictions of metamagics in an art.

Artless Metamagics
==================

Astralnaut (Mage)
-----------------
This metamagical technique eases the mage's ability to remain astral and grants them ease of travel to the astral sea. They hours for which they may safely astrally project are increased by their Ascension degree, and may pass into the astral sea directly, without having to hunt down an Astral Shore, by making a Potency + Translocation + Ascension degree (5) test. Success on this test immediately translates one's astral location to the Astral Sea.

Chant (Mage)
------------
Chant is the general term used on the street for any number of activities that a mage may use to focus his concentration on the act of magic. The typical hermetic mage mutters incantations in Latin or even Assyrian, a follower of Tir'an Elvhanan might speak in Sperethiel. Other mages have any number of other methods - some even dance. In game terms, this can be anything chosen by the player, but it must cause a sound that can be heard by the user at least as loud as a normally speaking voice. As a free action, a mage can begin their chant, gaining a bonus to all Warp resistance rolls equal to their Ascension degree for the rest of that action phase.

Mantra (Channeler)
------------------
Popularized by practitioners of the Jedi and Buddhist paradigms, the use of a mantra allows a Channeler to quiet his mind. Practitioners of other paradigms have other means, but primarily it comes down to some form of vocalization or repeated motion. In game terms, it may be anything chosen by the player, but it must cause a sound that can be heard by the user at least as loud as a normally speaking voice. As a free action, a channeler can begin their mantra, reducing all penalties to athletic and weapon skill tests by their Ascension degree for the rest of that turn.

Masking (Mage and Channeler)
----------------------------
Masking is the art of hiding your aura and your power. When you activate this metamagic as a free action, you create a 'mask' or fake aura. Anyone who assenses you and gets fewer hits than your Ascension degree gets information as if they had that many hits on assensing the fake aura you chose. If they get more hits than your Ascension degree, their net hits are applied to the assensing chart for your real aura, and they are aware of your masking. If they get no net hits but still reach the threshold, they become aware that you are using masking, but don't get any read on your aura. You may disable this metamagic as a free action, allowing people to see your aura normally.

Power Point (Channeler)
-----------------------
This one's simple. The channeler who selects this metamagic gains another power point that they may spend however they please, instead of any other benefit from ascending. This metamagic can be taken any number of times by a channeler, though they must still follow the restriction on completing Arts.
