The Astral World
================
The astral world is the world of thoughts and emotions, where how the world is perceived is as real as how it is. Physical things that are not touched by magic appear as grey, opaque representations of themselves, often slightly distorted by whatever strong emotions have been held near them.

Living things (and some types of magical objects), however, have auras: easiest to see are their emotional states, which require only minor concentration to see. At their heart, however, auras contain a vast amount of information about a living being - one's very soul. Nonetheless, auras are hazy and unclear on the astral.

Yet more vibrant in the astral world are astral forms. Astral forms are beings that exist on the astral primarily - or are dual-natured, existing in both the physical world and the astral one. Astral forms are colorful and distinct from the hazy world around them.

The astral world is filled with dangers and wonders: spirits flit across the skylines as numerous as the drones in the air, dragons and arcanists look out upon the world from high towers, and all the little people caught in between don't know what they're walking into.

Interacting with the Astral
===========================

Astral Projection
-----------------
Mages, and only mages, not Channelers or Arcane Channelers, may astrally project. They may use a complex action to gain the [Astral Essence] trait, and their physical body goes into a comatose state. They may safely remain in this state for a number of hours equal to their Potency. For every hour they remain in this state beyond this time, they must make a Willpower + Potency (hours greater than Potency) test or lose one point of Essence. They may use a free action to return to their body at any distance. The amount of time they have spent astrally projecting resets once they have spent as much time not astrally projecting as they previously spent out of their body.

Astral Perception
-----------------
Mages, along with Channelers and Arcane Channelers who purchase the Astral Perception power, can use a simple action to temporarily gain the [Dual-Natured] trait. This is the most normal form of perceiving and interacting with the astral world - as much as anything magical is common.

Numinous Perception
-------------------
When an astral form passes through a living creature's aura, that creature might notice, however mundane it is. Whenever an astral form passes through or even touches an aura, the owner of that aura may make an Intuition + Perception [Mental] (2) test, noticing the chill on the back of their neck and the coldness of their breath that results. Security personnel are trained to recognize this as the signs of an astral intruder.

Numinous perception is also used when mages work their arts nearby. Numinous perception is made against a threshold equal to the skill of the originator minus the Force of the effect. Numinous perception is used whenever a spell is cast or a rune is activated within 10 meters, whenever a spirit is being summoned or bound within 20 meters, whenever a ritual is performed within 30 meters, whenever a talisman is being made within 50 meters, and whenever a ceremony is performed within 1 km. Succeeding this sort of Numinous Perception test gives the creature an understanding that magic is happening and what direction it is in, nothing more.

Creatures with the [Awakened], [Dual-Natured], or [Astral Essence] traits have a +2 bonus to this test.

Rules in the Astral
===================
The Astral world follows different rules from physical reality, in addition to having no gravity and movement being determined by one's acuity of thought and soul.

Assensing
---------
Use of the Assensing skill can reveal a great deal of information about a target. Fully assensing a target takes a complex action and an assensing + intuition [astral] test. This is not the act of spotting things on the astral plane (such would use the Perception skill) but rather the art of distilling and interpreting what is seen into discrete facts. Your hits determine how much information you gain; you gain all the knowledge about your target as appropriate to your hits and all lower amounts of hits. Some abilities cause this test to have a threshold, or to be opposed, in which case your net hits or hits beyond the threshold determine the knowledge gained, as below.

If you do not get at least one hit (net or otherwise) you do not get any information from your attempt.

*One Hit:*

* A one-word summary of the subject's current emotional state
* The type of aura being assensed (magical effect, astral signature, living being, et cetera)
* Whether a living target is Awakened
* A one-word summary of the subject's state of health

*Two Hits:*

* Categorization of an aura, or source of a magical effect or astral signature (brew, rune, spell, spirit, human, et cetera)
* Presence of any spells anchored on a living target.
* Whether or not a living target has any cyberware.
* If you score two hits on assensing an aura, any time you score two hits on assensing that aura again, you recognize their aura regardless of physical disguises.
* Whether or not an Awakened subject has dabbled in the dark arts; that is, whether they've ever used any involuntary blood magic or performed a necromancy ritual.

*Three Hits:*

* Whether or not a living target has any bioware.
* The location of any cyberware in the target's body (by target location; lets, torso, head, arms).
* The target's Force, Potency, or Somatesthesia relative to the highest of your own. (higher, lower, or the same)
* For living creatures, the target's Essence relative to your own.
* A general understanding of what is affecting the target's physical health, if anything (disease, toxin, internal bleeding, et cetera)
* An advanced understanding of the target's emotional state, including undertones.

*Four Hits:*

* Whether or not the target has any geneware. 
* The location of any bioware in the target's body.
* If you score four hits on assensing an astral signature, you can recognize the owner of the astral signature if you score at least two hits on assensing their aura, or recognize the same astral signature with at least two hits on assensing it. Similarly, if you score four hits on assensing an aura, you can recognize any astral signature that is derived from that aura with two hits on the astral signature.
* Exact categorization of an aura or anchor, or source of astral signature (what brew, rune in what spell category, spell in what category, what spirit/talisman type, mage as opposed to channeler, etc.)
* The paradigm associated with an aura or astral form if applicable.
* If the target has used involuntary blood magic or performed a necromancy ritual, you become aware of which one, as well as whether they've taken the related art.

*Five Hits:*

* Whether or not the target has any nanoware. 
* The location of all 'ware in the target's body.
* A complete and precise diagnosis of the nature and symptoms of any ailment afflicting the target. With the appropriate knowledge skills, this can easily diagnose the target's ailments.
* The exact Potency, Somatesthesia, Essence, and/or Force of the target, as applicable. Essence rounded down to the nearest whole number.
* An understanding of what makes a character 'tick' - deep insights into their character that they may not be aware of, though not including specific knowledge.

*Six or More Hits:*

* Should provide all of the above information, at increasing detail.
* precise and identifying locations of 'ware
* what exact spell or rune left a given astral signature.
* basic understanding of what emotions were used in the casting of a spell or creation of a rune based on the astral signature left behind.
* a list of expanding detail and clarity of the initiatory powers gained by the subject.

Assensing a Location:
---------------------
Often, there is no individual aura to be assensed, but instead one wishes to understand the emotions generally present in an area. This is an Assensing + Intuition [Astral] (3) test that may target any area that may be entirely seen from one point within the area. On a success, this test discloses the following information:

* Most prevalent emotion felt in the location
* What paradigm has been most often used in the location in the last (total hits) weeks
* The exact rating of any background count, and whether it is positive or negative in nature
* Whether blood or toxic magic has been used in this place in the last (total hits) months

More hits should equate to more precise knowledge, such as whether it is blood or toxic magic exactly, the cause of a background count, whether the background count is aspected, et cetera.

Astral Combat
-------------
Combat on the astral is much like combat in the physical world. In order to make an attack on the astral, you must either be [Dual-Natured] or have the [Astral Essence] trait. All attacks in the astral world are melee attacks - ranged weapons simply do not function in the astral world. While creatures with [Dual-Natured] use dexterity as normal for attacks, all creatures use Charisma in place of strength for calculating the damage of astral attacks, regardless of whether they are [Dual-Natured] or an [Astral Essence].

Most weapons have no effect on astral entities - the only ones that can be used are telesmic weapons. See talismans for details on their functioning. 

Attacks in the astral world use their normal skills as appropriate to what is being used to make the attack - a talismanic sword still uses the blades skill. They are opposed by dodge as normal, including creatures with [Astral Essence] converting their intuition into agility.

Elemental damage inflicted in the astral world has none of its normal effects - except Void damage, which behaves normally.

Astral Damage
-------------
The astral world is far from safe. Being attacked on the astral by hostile spirits, other astrally projecting or perceiving creatures, or even encountering hostile astral phenomena can inflict damage to your soul if it’s on the astral.

Damage taken on the astral plane is always stun. If the stun condition monitor is filled for an astrally perceiving mage, channeler, or arcane channeler, they cease to be astrally perceiving. Mages who are knocked out while astrally projecting are returned to their bodies instantaneously. Creatures with [Dual-Natured] inherently remain so, and stun damage dealt on the astral to them while they are unconscious can still carry over into the physical condition monitor and eventually kill.

Disruption
----------
Being disrupted is not a pleasant experience, as any mage who has been astrally exploring will tell you. An astral form that is disrupted must immediately cease being an astral form: for astrally projecting humans, this means being forcibly returned to their bodies with a full Stun condition monitor. For active talismans, this means being deactivated. For active Runes and anchored spells, they end early. Creatures that cannot voluntarily cease being an astral form in a given location have their stun condition monitors filled, but suffer no other consequences.

The Astral and the Physical
===========================
Despite being separated, the astral world does have to interact with the physical in some ways, as its emotional shadow.

The Astral Stays Astral
-----------------------
Astral spells can be cast in the physical world, such as deathballs. Any effect originating on the physical world, no matter how mana-based, cannot impact an astral form. Likewise, no effect originating in the astral world can impact the physical world. The exception to this is [Dual-Natured] creatures and objects, which are both astral forms and physical beings. They may be targeted from either world, and may, when they create an astral effect, choose whether it occurs on the physical or the astral world.

Astral Intersection
-------------------
On the astral, lesser things like physical objects are opaque, meaning they block your astral line of sight, but they don't prevent the movement of purely astral forms through them. Astral forms that are disembodied can pass through such barriers unhindered, stopped only by other astral forms. However, the ability of an astral form to do anything beyond the astral is extremely limited without a body to occupy.

There are more awkward instances of physical objects interacting with the astral, however. Whenever a dual-natured object or creature is forced into contact with an astral form, each of them makes a test using the measure of their power; Potency + Willpower for mages, Somatesthesia + Willpower for channelers, Force times two for everything else. Whatever loses this test is disrupted. (see Disruption).

Finally, occasionally magical effects that are present in the astral are anchored to physical objects that are destroyed or dislocated in such a way that they cease to function in anchoring magic. Most often just destroyed. In these cases, whatever astral effect was present is destroyed, permanently unless otherwise stated.

Astral Phenomena
================
The Astral World is not a bland, unchanging place, nor is it even only moved by the tumultuous emotions of the living. Rather, strange forces beyond the earth and our reckoning move the astral world, causing a sort of astral weather that no mages have yet managed to fully predict.

Aspected Domains
----------------
Sometimes, a background count is flavored heavily by a certain set of beliefs that are conducive to a specific paradigm. This creates an aspected domain. Each aspected domain has a paradigm and a rating from 1 to 12. For those not of the Domain's paradigm, it acts simply as a positive background count of the same rating. For those of the same paradigm, however, the following effects replace the normal effects of the background count:

* Every test made that receives a bonus from a channeler power receives an additional bonus equal to the rating of the aspected domain.
* All tests made using a Potency or Somatesthesia attribute receive a bonus equal to the rating of the aspected domain.
* All Awakened creatures of the domain's paradigms treat their Astral limit as if it were increased by the rating of the aspected domain.

Astral Shore
------------
As part of the common sea analogue, the astral shore is a place where the barrier between worlds wears thin. Astral Shores have a rating from one to six, which is added as a bonus to any Summoning test made in the astral shore. Astrally projecting mages can use these areas to attempt to travel to the astral sea, making a Willpower + Potency (6 - Rating) test to do so. 

Astral Shores are normally not on the shore - normally, they occur around doors or portals of immense emotional significance - the longest-standing astral shore known to mankind is the Arc de Triomph in Paris, France. Passing through the gate whilst astrally projecting is an extraordinarily common way of reaching the Astral Sea.

Background Count
----------------
Background count is probably the most common astral phenomenon, and forms a basis upon which many others draw. Background count represents a buildup of residual energy in the environment or a void of energy, both of which make it difficult for magic-users to use their powers.

Background counts can be positive, representing buildup in energy that makes astral energy feel more like thick syrup than air, or negative, representing a void that makes it difficult to find energy to draw on at all. Any creature with magical power is aware that they've entered a background count if they do, but not its exact rating.

Positive background counts may become Domains in time, see domains. No background count except a Domain can grow inside a lodge, and must be of the lodge's owner's paradigm.

Background count ratings range from -12 to 12. The value of a background count is equal to the absolute value of the rating. Background counts of rating higher than 6 are extremely rare, and the average sprawl has a background count of 1 or -1 in particularly affected areas, at most 2 in the barrens.

A background count's value is applied in the following ways:

* Every channeler power that has a rating has its rating reduced by the value of the background count.
* The limit of any test made using a Potency or Somatesthesia attribute is reduced by the value of the background count.
* If a talisman enters a background count with a higher value than its Force, it is deactivated and cannot be reactivated until it leaves the background count.
* If an [Awakened] creature enters a background count with a higher value than its Potency or Somatesthesia, it cannot use any magical abilities (including Channeler powers, magical activities, and critter powers with the magical tag). This does not strip [Dual-Natured] or [Astral Essence] from creatures who have it inherently, but does prevent mages and channelers from astrally perceiving and mages from astrally projecting.

How Background Counts Happen:

Background counts are generated by the following events:

* A failed ceremony generates a background count equal to its Force.

Background counts generated in this way lose one rating per hour until they cease to exist.

* Any event of extreme emotional significance (such as concentrated death) to ten or more people. This generates a background count rating equal to the power of ten of the people the significance is held for (10, 100, 1000, etc.)

Background counts generated in this way lose one rating per days equal to the number of people involved until they cease to exist.

* Repeated significant magical activity (meaning of a Force greater than the current background count) in a single location at least once per month for a year generates a rating one background count, which increases each new rating's year the activities continue to be repeated (one year for rating one, two years for rating two, etc.)

Background counts generated in this way lose one rating per year in which they are not maintained by further magical activity of equal force to the background count. This means generates an aspected domain if the magical activity is always of the same paradigm.

Mana Storms
-----------
Mana storms are almost universally accompanied by some form of unnatural weather. Mana storms have a rating between one and nine (inclusive). They come with a background count equal to three plus their rating, but that's the least of their danger to the Awakened. No magical creature is rendered unable to use its power by a mana storm - instead, once per Turn per creature, when a creature that would be rendered unable to use its magical abilities by the background count performs any action at all related to any of its magical abilities (a test to use or affected by a Channeler power, casting a spell, et cetera) the GM rolls on the Mana Surge Table.

Mana storms may be stationary or mobile, traveling at a speed up to their rating in kmph, but either way are only temporary - a mana storm's rating decreases by one per day from its inception. They may come out of anywhere, though.

*Witch's Mark is the result that invites the GM to be creative. The magical effect ceases to be effective (a spell has no effect, a channeler power does not grant any bonus or do anything) and a totally bizarre mishap occurs. Frogs may rain from the sky, nearby water may catch fire with purple flames, or a small portal to the astral world may dump a Fey on the unfortunate Awakened. Caveat Emptor for those who use magic during a mana storm.
