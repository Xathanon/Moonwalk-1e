Channeler Powers
================
Powers are the building blocks of a Channeler's powers. Most powers only affect the Channeler - if there is no contrary text, assume that it only affects the Channeler. Some powers require actions to activate, as specified in their descriptions, while others are passive. All powers have a cost in power points, again specified in their descriptions. Any power may be deactivated with a free action, including passive powers; passive powers may be reactivated with a free action.

Powers are given in the following format:

Elemental Blows
---------------
Simple, <.5>
A Channeler with Elemental Blows can convert their personal magic into elemental energy. They may select a single elemental damage type. While this power is active, all attacks they make with a weapon focus or unarmed strike counts as damage of that damage type. This power automatically ends if the Channeler is rendered unconscious.

A Channeler may purchase this power multiple times, each time selecting a different elemental damage type. Only one such version of the power may be activate at a time, however.

Elemental Form
--------------
Free, <.5>

You must have the Elemental Blows power to select this power.

You gain the [Element Form (X)] trait where X is the element you selected for Elemental Blows. This trait uses your Somatesthesia in place of Potency. This power is deactivated if the Channeler is knocked unconscious.

Empathic Healing
----------------
Complex, <.5>

Empathic Healing is a dangerous art practiced only in times of great need. A Channeler with this power may use a Complex action while touching another being who is injured to make a Somatesthesia + Willpower (Astral) test. For every hit, the Channeler removes one box of damage from their choice of the target's Overflow or Physical Condition Monitor, and takes one box of physical damage, unresisted. Targeting a character with less than 6 essence with this ability causes a penalty to the roll equal to (6-target's essence).

Damage dealt to the Channeler by this power can only be healed through natural healing.

Kiai
----
Simple, <1>

A Channeler with Kiai is a terrifying force - literally. When the Channeler activates this power, they let out a terrifying battle roar, soul-scream, etc. as appropriate to their paradigm.

All creatures within a number of meters of the Channeler equal to their Somatesthesia must make a Willpower + Charisma (Channelerâ€™s Somatesthesia/2) test or be forced to flee from the Channeler for (threshold - hits) Action Phases by the most direct path that does not lead to obvious harm. If there is nowhere to run to, it may only use the Take Cover action and may not willingly move nearer to the Channeler.

Magic Resistance

Channelers with magic resistance are often the bane of overconfident mages. Magic resistance grants a +1 modifier to all tests made to resist magical activities.

Pain Resistance
---------------
Passive, <1/Rank>

A Channeler using Pain Resistance can undo the impact of pain on their effectiveness. They may ignore an amount of penalties due to filled boxes in their stun condition monitor equal to their ranks in this power.

Physical Attribute Boost
------------------------
Free, <.25/Rank>

A Channeler with this power calls upon inner power to unlock the gates of potential, if only for a moment. This power must be purchased for a specific physical attribute. Upon activation, the Channeler's rating for that attribute is augmented by their rank in this power for the current turn. After the turn, they must resist Warp equal to their ranks in this power.
