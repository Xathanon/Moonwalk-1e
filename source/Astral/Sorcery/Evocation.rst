Evocation and Ceremonies
========================
Ceremonies are formulaic methods of drawing out magical energies from an exterior source as well as directly from the astral, which results in the destruction of the source, better known as the sacrifice. Ceremonies are long, complex, and more powerful than rituals or spells by several orders of magnitude.

Ceremonies are immensely powerful. No general descriptors or tags are used to categorize them. Nonetheless, ceremonies do have the following criteria:

* Minimum participants. No ceremonies can be performed by a lone practitioner of magic, and all participants and the leader must use the same paradigm. If at any point there are fewer active participants than the minimum, the ceremony immediately fails. The leader does not count as a participant.
* Sacrifice. Every ceremony requires a sacrifice, normally in expensive and rare components. The difficulty of acquiring the components of a given ceremony is listed in its description.
* Nexus. No ceremonies can be performed without a nexus of the paradigm of the participants. The nexus acts as the origin point for all ceremonies.
* Warp. Each ceremony inflicts stun Warp on all participants and the leader if it is successful. This Warp is listed in the entry of each ceremony.

Performing Ceremonies
---------------------
Ceremonies are divided into three phases; Praxis, Telete, and Agon.

*Praxis:* Praxis is the step of preparation and gathering; materials are gathered, the Nexus is made ready, and the energy for the ceremony is gathered. The sacrifice of a Praxis step tends to be a material or object heavy in magical power related to the effect of the ceremony.

*Telete:* Telete is the step of targeting and guiding; the methods are readied, any physical components that must be constructed as part of the ceremony tend to be created in this step. The sacrifice of a Telete step tends to be a reagent Brew (such as Quicksilver Draught) relating to the methods of the ceremony.

*Agon:* Agon is the step of final striving; the power prepared is channeled through the methods and the target is named. The sacrifice of an Agon step tends to be intimately related to the nature of the target, often including a Link. If the Agon lists an opposed test, it is against the target of the ceremony.

Each phase has a test required of the leader of the ceremony, and a test required of each participant. Each participant who fails their test immediately suffers the Warp of the ceremony - as Physical damage instead of Stun - but if a number of participants equal to the minimum participants pass the test, the ceremony itself does not fail. If the leader fails any tests, the entire ceremony immediately fails.

Teamwork tests may not be used to assist the leader, or among the participants of, the ceremony - each task is highly individual.

Learning Ceremonies
-------------------
Ceremonies are above and beyond in complexity. They may not be learned from formulae, since no formulae for ceremonies exist - they must be learned from teachers or spirits who already know the ceremony, or created. A teacher provides a teamwork test - and a spirit may if they are so inclined. Learning a ceremony requires a ownership of and access to a Nexus for the duration of the learning period. The learning test for a ceremony is Logic + Arcana [Mental] (10, 1 week) extended test. The threshold for this test is doubled if one does not have a teacher. If this test is successfully completed, the mage may spend 15 BP to learn the new ceremony.

Some ceremonies have prerequisites that must be acquired before the ceremony can be learned.

Creating Ceremonies
-------------------
GMs and players (with the permission, oversight, and approval of their GMs) are invited to create ceremonies of their own for player and NPC use. The key to appropriate ceremonies are as follows:

* Complexity. Ceremonies should never be simple; hours should be spent performing them and making every detail perfect, due to the sheer amount of magic being wielded.
* Sacrifice. To bring about the effect of a ceremony, something magical and/or spiritually significant has to be sacrificed, permanently.
* Permanence. The effects of ceremonies can't be undone by abjuration, but have to be unmade the hard way - sometimes by other ceremonies.
* Risk. Ceremonies bring about inherent risk. They often have prerequisites that aren't under the evoker's control, such as lunar phases or astrological confluences that can be misinterpreted.
* Difficulty. In the end, Ceremonies are hard to complete entirely and properly, and not just numerically; locals and animals tend to be perturbed by massive magical activities.
* Catastrophe. Even when they're successful, Ceremonies bring about massive Warp. When they fail, the side-effects of all that mana being loosed without guidance has horrifying consequences.

Especially for ceremonies that one is inventing or learning without a teacher, the risk of it should be accentuated. Learning a ceremony that a player character (not just a player) has invented for themselves falls under the rules for learning a ceremony without a teacher, but is otherwise learned normally.

A Practical Note
----------------
Ceremonies are often not designed with practical use in mind; they are powerful, permanent effects often inconvenient to GMs and the world, and can require an entire session to prepare for and perform. As such, we highly recommend advanced discussions of the use of the Evocation skill between the GM and any interested mages before the game begins - or before the mage purchases any ranks in it.
