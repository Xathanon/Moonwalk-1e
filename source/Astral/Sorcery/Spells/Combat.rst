Combat Spell Category
=====================
Combat spells are first divided by whether they are Astral or Terrestrial.

Astral combat spells are subtle, resisted by Willpower, and deal the caster's net hits in damage that is not resisted further.

Terrestrial combat spells are overt, and are spell attacks. They have a base damage value of the Force of the spell, and AP on the attack equal to half their Force. Damage dealt by these spells is resisted normally. Terrestrial combat spells with the area tag are not resisted (meaning there is no dodge test) but instead are treated as explosives, using the casting test as the placement test, and the same damage calculation as a normal spell. Terrestrial area combat spells lose two damage per meter from the blast point.

All combat spells have a duration of Instantaneous, and specify whether they deal Physical or Stun damage. 

Combat spells are given in the following format:
