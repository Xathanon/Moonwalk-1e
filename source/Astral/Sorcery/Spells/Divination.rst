Divination Spell Category
=========================
Divination spells are based on gaining knowledge about one's environment, adding additional senses, and gaining knowledge about a specific, focused target. Each divination spell has either the detection, enhancement, or focused tag.

* Detection divinations have a special range: they extend out to their Force times the caster's Potency in meters, and have a default duration of Instantaneous. When you cast a Detection divination spell, you may add an additional 3 Warp to the spell's Warp Code to make its duration Sustained instead of Instantaneous. Sustained detection spells grant the caster the ability to sense the target whenever it is in range, but are not a precise sense (at most they'll get cardinal direction and near/far based on the range of the spell).
* Enhancement divinations have the range of touch, granting their target the sense specified. All Enhancement spells have a duration of Sustained
* Focused divinations always have a range of melee, and grant deep insight into the individual target. Creatures resist focused divinations with Intuition + Willpower, making the casting test for focused divinations into an opposed test. Focused divinations cast on objects must overcome the Object Resistance threshold instead. Objects with an aura or astral form may use their Force in place of Object Resistance for resisting a focused divination if it is higher. A willing, living subject may choose to score no hits when subjected to such a spell.

All divinations are Astral spells. All divinations are subtle; Focused divinations are treated as overt only to the target. The results of a divination spell, in precision, are given in the table below.
