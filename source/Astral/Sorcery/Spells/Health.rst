Health Spell Category
=====================

* Health spells are always terrestrial, and always have a range of Touch.
* Health spells are negatively impacted by lost essence. Targeting a character with less than 6 essence with a spell with the Essence tag means that the casting roll will suffer a penalty equal to (6-target's essence).
* Health spells may have the Negative tag. This means that they inflict turn the body's functioning against it (such as inflicting diseases). Such spells are opposed by Fortitude + Willpower, and deal one unresisted box of physical damage per net hit in addition to their other effects.
* Health spells may only be cast on living things with auras.
