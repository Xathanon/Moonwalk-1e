Invocation and Rituals
======================
Invocation is one of the more feared uses of magic; it's not as mysterious as evocation or summoning, but it still involves long periods of time, normally spent chanting ominously or performing other traditional actions. Rituals can be performed any number of participants, minimum one - someone has to be doing it.

The prime difference between a ritual and a spell is complexity, followed by distance, followed by duration. Rituals may cause abstract physical effects such as 'healing' that are too complex for brute will, at greater distances and through greater intervening obstacles than spells, and may bring about lasting (but not permanent) effects of a magical nature.

A ritual consists of the following seven steps:

* **Choose a leader.** The leader of the ritual is the only participant that must know the ritual being invoked. If a mage invokes a ritual alone, they are the leader by default.
* **Choose the ritual & Force.** Pretty self-explanatory - you must select what ritual you are casting from the rituals the leader knows, and the maximum Force of the ritual is based on the leader's Potency.
* **Prepare the site.** Performing a ritual requires some small amount of preparation to the area where it is being performed; this step generates a visible astral phenomenon in a sphere around the leader with a radius in meters equal to the Force of the ritual. After this step, if any participants leave the area, the ritual automatically fails.
* **Make the offering.** In order to invoke a ritual, you must spend reagents, at least as many as the Force of the ritual. These reagents must be of the leader's tradition, and contribute to the sealing step significantly.
* **Perform the ritual.** During this step, the actual steps of the ritual are performed. The duration of this step is ten minutes per Force of the ritual.
* **Seal the ritual.** Once the ritual's steps have been performed, the leader must invoke their power to seal the ritual's steps. They make an Invocation + Potency [Reagents Spent] (Force) test. Each other participant in the ritual makes a teamwork test to assist them. On a success, the ritual is successfully completed.
* **Resist Warp.** After the ritual is completed, all participants in the ritual must resist Warp equal to twice the Force of the ritual. This Warp is only physical for the participants if the Force of the ritual is greater than the leader's Potency.

Ritual effects bear the astral signatures of all participants.

Learning Rituals
----------------
Rituals are more complicated affairs, but may still be learned from a teacher or formula. Ritual formulae may be crafted (see crafting) but be aware that they are far more complex and difficult to craft. A teacher provides a teamwork test for the learning test as for a spell. Learning a ritual must be performed in a magical lodge belonging to you. The learning test for a ritual is a Logic + Arcana [Mental] (10, 1 day) extended test. If this test is successfully completed, the mage may spend 10 BP to learn the new ritual.

Ritual Characteristics
----------------------
Rituals have characteristics, much as other magical activities do.

* All rituals require a target location or a target aura (noted in the description), and draw an astral line of effect from the leader's location to the target. The leader must be able to perceive the target of the ritual with a precise sense but there are no other prerequisites for range unless otherwise stated in the ritual's description.
* All rituals have a duration. This can be Instantaneous or Sustained (as spells), or a ritual can have a duration of Lasting: this means that the ritual's effects last a number of days equal to the net hits on the sealing step. Lasting and Sustained rituals are anchored effects.

In addition, rituals often have tags, like spells do, that determine parts of their functioning.

* *Link.* Some rituals specify that they require a Link to their target. This rituals do not require the leader to be able to perceive the target with a precise sense.
* *Category.* Some rituals are kin enough to spells to be considered part of the spell category. Any affect that applies to one's casting of spells of a specific category also applies to invoking rituals of the same category (note that this does not include bonuses to casting spells in general).

Ritual List
===========
Rituals are listed in the following format:

Name
----
Target Type, Duration (Tag)

Description

Anointed Weapon
---------------
Special, Lasting

This ritual targets any inanimate object; the Force of the ritual must be at least as great as the Object Resistance of the object. For the duration of the effect, the object is dual-natured, and its astral form bears the anchor of the ritual. If it is disrupted, the ritual's effect ends immediately.

Cryptesthesia
-------------
Location or Aura, Sustained (Link) (Category: Divination)

Cryptesthesia allows the ritual leader to perceive distant locations as if they were there. At the location to which they have a link, the anchor serves as an invisible, intangible sensor which has a precise sense with a range equal to the Force of the ritual, through which the ritual leader and all participants may perceive. This sensor must use a sense which the leader has.

Naming
------
Aura, Instantaneous (Link)

Naming allows the sorcerer to create a copy of a specific spirit's Name. The ritual must be performed at a Force equal to or greater than the spirit's Force, and requires that the sorcerer has previously assensed the spirit and achieved five hits, is in the presence of the willing spirit, or currently has the spirit bound in their service (this requires the use of a service). All copies of a spirit's Name are Links to the spirit, and are destroyed on the spirit's permanent destruction (but not exorcism, disruption, etc.).

Restoration
-----------
Aura, Instantaneous (Link)

Restoration is the staple of a sorcerer who deals in medicine. When the ritual is sealed, the target removes a total number of boxes from his physical, overflow, and stun condition monitors equal to the Force of the ritual. The target also does not take damage from the Bleeding Out condition while this ritual is being performed, and loses that condition when the ritual is sealed if they have it.

Search
------
Aura, Instantaneous (Link) (Category: Divination)

This spell acts as a detection divination spell directed at the target for which the leader has a link. This detection calculates its range in kilometers instead of meters and uses the net hits on the sealing test to determine precision as if it were a detection.

Spellbloom
----------
Location or Aura, Special (Link)

When the Spellbloom ritual is cast, the caster must select a spell that they know. The duration of the ritual is equivalent to the duration of the spell selected. This ritual causes the spell to take effect at a Force equal to the Force of the ritual. The spell is cast as if from the target's location, targeting the target of the ritual. Note that an astral line of effect must still be drawn from the ritual leader to the target's location. The net hits on the sealing step are used as hits for the casting roll of the spell. Spells used in this way cannot be dodged, since they originate from the target's own aura's location.

Transfiguration
---------------
Aura, Lasting (Link)

This ritual forces the target to assume an animal form. The net hits on the sealing step of the ritual must equal or exceed the absolute value of the difference between the target's Fortitude and the animal's Fortitude. While transformed, the target has full access to all physical traits and attributes of the animal, but retains their own mental attributes, mental traits and spiritual traits. Any modifications to the target for which essence was paid are adapted into their new form, and return to their old form when the ritual's effects end. The GM determines what other equipment damage and issues are appropriate to the target's sudden transformation. This ritual can only transform the target into the form of a non-magical animal.

Any changes that happen to the animal form of itself, substances excreted or produced in the animal form, and parts taken from the animal form vanish at the end of the effect with no impact to the original form. Any changes to equipment essence was paid for remain when the equipment returns to the character's original body.

Ward
----
Location, Lasting

This ritual creates an astral form, in the shape of a sphere with a radius equal to the ritual's Force squared, or a single square wall with each side equal to the ritual's Force. This astral form is unusual in that it is permeable to astral forms that bear the astral signature of the ritual participants or leader, and the astral line of sight and effect of any magical activities that bear the astral signature of the ritual leader or any of the participants, without causing an astral intersection.
