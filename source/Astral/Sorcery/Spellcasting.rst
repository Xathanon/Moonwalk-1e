Spellcasting
============
Spellcasting is the act of bringing forth immediate or sustained magical results on a personal scale that can be manifested at a whim. This is accomplished by use of the Wyrding skill, which is immediate flexing of astral capability.

Casting Spells
--------------
Casting a spell is a relatively short process: you select a spell (and any parameters it requires), choose the Force of the spell, roll Wyrding + Potency [Force], resolve the effects, then resist the Warp appropriate to the spell and the force. Each spell states how its casting test (the above Wyrding + Potency [Force] test) is used, a code for calculating how much Warp is suffered based on Force. Warp inflicted by a spell is stun by default, but becomes physical if the Force of the spell is greater than the caster's Potency. This process takes one complex action.

Some spells are resisted; in this instance, the casting test is an opposed test against the specified test made to resist the spell, and only the caster's net hits on the casting test are used.

Learning Spells
---------------
Learning a spell requires either a teacher or a spell formula. Spell formulae may be crafted (see crafting). A teacher provides a teamwork test for the Learning Test. The Learning Test for a spell is a Logic + Arcana [Lodge Force] (5, 1 day) extended test. If this test is successfully completed, the mage may spend 5 BP to learn the new spell.

Spell Parameters
================
All spells have certain parameters; some are automatically filled out by the category of spells to which an individual spell belongs.

* Range. Rangers are divided into four categories.

  * Melee. The caster must be within Force/2 meters of the target and be aware of their location.
  * Touch. The caster must make a successful touch attack against any unwilling target as part of the casting action, casting the spell only if they successfully make contact. The caster must still touch willing targets, but does not need to make an attack to do so.
  * Line of Sight. The caster must be able to draw a line of sight from himself to the target, using the normal rules for the Line of Sight range (Whether it is Astral or Physical Line of Sight is determined by whether the caster is casting the spell in the astral (available only for Astral spells) or in the physical world)
  * Self. The spell can only target the caster.

* Astral/Terrestrial
This tag determines how the spell manifests. 
  * Astral spells use an astral line of effect. Additionally, only astral spells can be cast in the astral world. Astral spells cannot be cast upon targets that do not have an aura.
  * Terrestrial spells draw a terrestrial line of effect.

* Warp Code

  * This calculation includes the variable F, which stands for the spell's Force, as chosen during the casting. The output of the calculation is Warp that must be resisted (see :doc:`Source/Astral/Magical Vulnerabilities`

* Duration

  * Sustained. Sustained effects last as long as the caster sustains them, regardless of whether the target moves out of the casting range of the spell. Sustaining a spell inflicts a -2 penalty on all actions taken.
  * Instantaneous. Instantaneous effects happen once, and then are complete. Any changes wrought in the environment by the spell are no longer dependent on mana to subsist (such as the smoking hole in the side of a building).

* Subtle/Overt

  * Subtle spells have no direct signs of their casting, and in order to detect a subtle spell being cast near you, you must make a numinous perception test.
  * Overt spells are obvious, and anyone who can see the caster is instantly aware that they are casting the spell.

Any other descriptors used for spells are called **Tags**.

* Area Spells: Some spells have the Area tag. Under those circumstances, a line of sight spell draws a second line of effect from the original target point to each other valid target within Force meters of the original target point, and a melee spell targets all targets within range of the spell from the caster. Each target of an Area spell must resist it separately, but only one casting test is made.
* Category-Specific Tags: Most spell categories have unique tags that apply to their spells.

Spell Interactions & Keywords
=============================

Spell Anchors
-------------
A spell is said to be anchored if it is a spell that is sustained. For sustained area spells, any valid target that enters the radius of the spell from its anchor while it is being sustained is immediately subject to the spell's effects (which it may resist as normal).

Spell Attacks
-------------
Some spells use the Casting Test as an attack (as per Attacks). Such spells are normally in the Combat category, but not always. Spell attacks are not subject to wind or range modifiers, but are subject to visibility modifiers, background count (as it's still a casting test) and the range limitations of the spell being used. Spells do not suffer from range modifiers.

When a creature resists a spell attack, they do so by making a standard dodge test.

Spell Index
===========
Spells are listed by their categorization in each of the six categories.

* :doc:`Spells/Combat`. Combat spells are more or less a subcategory of kinesis spells; those spells designed specifically to bring about harm and destruction.
* :doc:`Spells/Divination`. Divination spells are sensory spells; they detect, perceive, and add additional senses to one's faculties.
* :doc:`Spells/Health`. Health spells affect the body's functions, amplifying or decaying.
* :doc:`Spells/Illusion`. Illusion spells bring about bending light and unreal imagery.
* :doc:`Spells/Kinesis`. Kinesis spells move energy and matter to the will of the practitioner.
* :doc:`Spells/Psionic`. Psionic spells affect the functioning of other entities' minds, breaking, deceiving, and controlling.
