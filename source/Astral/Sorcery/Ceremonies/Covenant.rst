Covenant
========
The formation of a covenant is truly terrifying; three mages uniting their power in a bond that strengthens all of them. Covenants are historical pacts among the greats, but also lesser mages often use them to get ahead of their peers. The formation of a Covenant is far less risky than most other ceremonies.

*Minimum Participants:* A Covenant requires two participants. However, all participants are treated as the leaders of the ceremony, for a total of three leaders, and channelers cannot be used as mana batteries for this ceremony.

*Warp:* The Warp inflicted by a Covenant is equal to the highest Potency of any of the leaders.

Praxis
------
The Praxis of a Covenant is called "Inscribing the Bond." During this phase of the ceremony, the leaders make a physical imprint on the other targets, which is echoed in all of their astral forms.

*Tests:* Each leader of the ceremony must choose one other co-leader, who cannot be chosen by the third. Each leader then must make a Potency + Creation [Astral] (Potency of the chosen target) test.

*Sacrifice:* The Praxis of a Covenant uses three doses of Anointment, one for each co-leader.

*Time:* The first phase of a Covenant takes ten minutes times the highest Potency of any of the co-leaders.

Telete
------
The Telete of a Covenant is the preparation of a special brew. This brew is unique to each Covenant, to each participant and to their paradigm.

*Tests:* Each leader of the ceremony must make a Potency + Evocation [Force of the Nexus] (Highest Potency of the leaders) test.

*Sacrifice:* This phase of a Covenant requires reagents equal to the highest Potency of any of the leaders and a Link to each leader.

*Time:* The Telete of a Covenant takes three hours.

Agon
----
The Agon of a Covenant is not a standard Agon; instead of actively unleashing the power of the ceremony, it is a matter of withstanding the energy prepared for onesself, namely by drinking and surviving the Brew - sometimes called the Blood of the Covenant.

*Tests:* Each leader of the ceremony must resist an amount of Physical damage equal to the sum of the potency of all leaders, with only Willpower + Fortitude. If all three participants survive, this phase (and the ceremony) is successful.

*Sacrifice:* The Sacrifice of the Agon of a Covenant is one point of Essence from each leader.

*Time:* The final phase of a Covenant takes but a singular Simple Action per Leader, to drink the Brew. The damage is resisted instantly.

Success
-------
If the Covenant is successful, the leaders do not lose magic or maximum magic with the lost point of Essence. All other effects of losing a point of Essence remain. The three leaders become bound in a mutual astral connection, which can be seen with five hits on assensing any of them. This covenant, or coven for short, excludes the formation of any other Covenants. Such Covenants automatically fail during the Telete.

The Covenant grants the following effects to the leaders of the ceremony (heretofore refered to as members of the Coven).

* Whenever any member performs a magical activity that would inflict Warp, they may draw on the power of the other two, gaining a bonus to their test made to resist Warp equal to the average Potency of the other two. However, when the Warp has been resisted, if any remains, it is suffered unresisted by all three members of the Coven.
* Any member of the Coven may be used as a Link to either of the other two.
* When the Coven performs a Ceremony together, they may choose to co-lead. In this case, they require other participants to fulfil the tasks appropriate to the participants, and none of them count as participants, but instead all count as leaders. When this is done, each of them performs the test for one phase, and the other two may perform teamwork tests to assist them in performing the Ceremony.

Failure
-------
Failing a Covenant has nasty side-effects - like most Ceremonies.

*Praxis:* Failure during a Praxis permanently inflicts all three leaders with an astral mark. Anyone who gets four hits to assense any of them becomes aware of this mark. Unless they proceed to succeed a Logic + Arcana [Mental] (3) test on seeing it, they believe the mark is that of the dark arts and react accordingly.

*Telete:* Failure during the Telete is relatively benign, inflicting no consequences beyond the normal ones for failing a ceremony during the Telete.

*Agon:* Failure during the Agon consists of one of the leaders dying. That ultimate price is already paid. The other two must simply suffer the Warp of the ceremony as normal for failing a ceremony.
