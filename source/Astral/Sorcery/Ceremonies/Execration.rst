Execration
==========
Execration is a ceremony that wreaks havoc and eventually death upon its target. Learning this ceremony requires the Symbolic Linking metamagic.

*Minimum Participants:* The minimum participants for an Execration is four.

*Warp:* The Execration ceremony inflicts Warp equal to twice the target's Essence.

Praxis
------
The first phase of an Execration is calling forth a mana storm. This must be done carefully, as if it isn't, it's unleashed generally within the Nexus.

*Tests:* The Leader must make a Potency + Creation [Astral] (7) test to appropriately shape the astral energies. Each participant must make a Potency + Summoning (5) test to call forth sufficient energy for the leader to shape.

*Sacrifice:* The Praxis requires the use of three services each from one spirit bound to the leader of each type the paradigm can summon.

*Time:* This phase of an Execration takes seven hours.

Telete
------
The second phase of an Execration is targeting the victim. During this phase, all of the participants must astrally project. Their following departure from the Nexus does not cause themselves to fail the ceremony. At the beginning of this phase, a rating 1 Aspected Domain is formed around the target of the leader's paradigm.

*Tests:* The Leader must make a Potency + Performance [Astral] (Charisma of the target) test to evoke their name properly and perfectly. Each participant must make an Intuition + Translocation [Astral] (distance from the nexus to the target in km divided by 10) test - the astral forms of all those who succeed converge upon the target's location, and must remain within meters of the target equal to the target's Essence. Any of them who leave that area fail the ceremony.

*Sacrifice:* The targeting requires one Link to the target per participant. Non-standard Links affect only the tests of the participants. The leader must have a Link to the target doused in a Quicksilver Draught, or the Name of the target if it is a spirit.

*Time:* The Telete of an Execration takes 5 minutes per km of distance between the Nexus and the target.

Agon
----
The Agon of an Execration is unleashing the mana storm's energy upon the target. Upon the conclusion of this phase, all participants are returned to their bodies instantly, regardless of intervening distance.

*Tests:* The Leader must make a Potency + Evocation [Force of the Nexus] vs. Willpower + Charisma test to unleash the energy properly on the target. Each participant must make a Potency + Summoning [Astral] (distance from the nexus to the target in km divided by 10) test to call the energies to the target.

*Sacrifice:* The calling phase of an Execration requires three services each of four spirits bound to the leader, one of each type that can be summoned by the leader's paradigm.

*Time:* This phase of an Execration takes one hour per Essence of the target.

Success
-------
Success for the Execration ceremony most often results in immediate and painful death for the target. The target loses a number of points of Essence equal to the leader's net hits during the Agon, and takes three times as much unresisted Physical damage.

Failure
-------
Failure effects for the Execration ceremony typically result in the massive destructive energies of the Execration spiralling out of control.

*Praxis:* If the ceremony is failed during the Praxis phase, the summoned energies fail to form, and instead implodes into the astral sea. The ceremony generates a rating 2 astral shallow on the Nexus. The Leader is forced to astrally project and is instantly transported into the Astral Sea.

*Telete:* The ceremony proceeds as normal without appearing to fail, and does not trigger any consequences whatsoever. However, it targets a random participant instead of the intended victim.

*Agon:* The summoned energies tear through astral space, creating a Force 7 Mana Storm at the source nexus, which proceeds as far as it can towards the target before it dissipates.
