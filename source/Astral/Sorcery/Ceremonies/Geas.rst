Geas
====
Sometimes, just binding spirits isn't enough. Mages cruel enough to bind other sapients are not uncommon in the Third Cycle; mages both the cruel and well-prepared enough to perform this ceremony are very rare indeed. The sapient target of this ceremony must be physically present and conscious at the the nexus where this ceremony is performed on them.

*Minimum Participants:* The minimum participants for a Geas is two.

*Warp:* The Warp to be resisted upon the completion of a Geas is equal to twice the target's Willpower.

Praxis
------
The Praxis of a Geas is perhaps the simplest phase; it induces a solipsistic state of pseudo-consciousness that is spiritually manipulated and bound. From the conclusion of this phase until the completion of the Ceremony, the target gains the unconscious condition.

*Tests:* The leader must make a Potency + Wyrding [Astral] vs. Willpower + Charisma opposed test. Each participant must be [Dual-Natured] and make a Potency + Performance [Astral] (3) test to appropriately set the astral stage.

*Sacrifice:* One reagent per Willpower of the target and a dose of Atraline.

*Time:* This phase takes one hour per Willpower of the target. Note that the target must normally be physically restrained to prevent them from escape during this phase.

Telete
------
The third phase of a Geas is imprinting commands upon the target, physically imprinting the target with words of power.

*Tests:* The Leader must make a Potency + Illustration [Astral] (Willpower of the target) test. Each participant must make a Potency + Wyrding [Astral] (Essence of the target) test to impose the words on the target as they are inscribed.

*Sacrifice:* The target must have a dose of Anointment used on them during this phase of the ceremony.

*Time:* This phase takes ten minutes.

Agon
----
The Agon of a Geas is enforcing the binding with an astral chain. The strength of this chain determines the ultimate efficacy of the ceremony.

*Tests:* The leader must make a Potency + Evocation [Force of the Nexus] vs. Willpower + Essence opposed test. Each participant must make a Potency + Creation [Force of the Nexus] test. The average hits of all participants should be recorded as they are used in the final result.

*Sacrifice:* A chain shaped in cold iron, doused in a dose of Quicksilver Draught, and painted in the blood of the victim. The chain is not destroyed as most sacrifices are; instead it becomes the focus of the ceremony's dominion.

*Time:* This phase takes one minute per Essence of the target.

Success
-------
Success in a Geas ceremony binds the target to service to the leader of the ceremony. They may not not directly attack or attempt to kill or harm the leader of the ceremony (at the GM's discretion), and owe a number of services to the leader (and only the leader) equal to the net hits on the opposed test made in Agon. 

For a spirit, these services may be used in any way appropriate to a bound spirit; spirits bound with a geas may not aid sorcery or study, and may not aid artifice for runes (they may aid with the creation of Brews).

For non-spirit entities, these services may be used in the following ways:

* Combat: The victim engages in combat on the leader's behalf, following the leader's commands and not attacking the leader or their allies. Tests and whatnot made as part of combat are not their own services, but one service is used per Action Phase.
* Task: The victim performs a test or non-test action on the leader's behalf. What constitutes a separate task is at the GM's discretion.
* Deference: The victim ceases an activity they were performing (and does not resume it until ordered to, permitted to, or the next sunset) and, if requested, immediately departs to the leader's location.

These services are mental compulsions, and may be resisted; when the Command action is used to command an entity bound with a Geas, the leader of the ceremony must make a Willpower + Potency vs. Willpower + Charisma opposed test against the target if the target isn't willing to obey. If the target is successful, the service is not used, but the target is not forced to perform it.

In order to use the services generated, however, the leader of the ceremony must be in possession of the chain used as a sacrifice in the Agon, and the victim must be within range of the spirit-summoner link. The chain becomes a dual-natured object with a Force equal to the average hits of the participants in phase 3 of the ceremony, and its structure rating becomes equal to its Force if it was lower. The chain can be used as a Link to the victim of the ceremony.

Finally, any mage who has possession of the chain may use a complex action to tear out the chain, whether or not any services remain. They must make a Potency + Negation [Astral] vs. Willpower + Charisma opposed test against the victim of the chain. If they are successful, the chain is destroyed, and takes a chunk of the target's soul with it; the victim's Essence is reduced by the Force of the chain, plus or minus an amount up to the abjurer's net hits on the opposed test (abjurer's choice of how much and whether to add or subtract). Either way, this destroys the chain.

Failure
-------
Failure in a Geas tends to cause issues with the enforcement of the terms. The failure effects for each phase are different, and add to the effects of the phase prior.

*Praxis:* Failure during the first phase of a Geas causes a solipsistic coma for all living creatures within the nexus where the ceremony is being attempted. This coma lasts for a number of days equal to the Force of the nexus.

*Telete:* Failing the Telete of a Geas causes improper inscription. The effects of failing the Praxis do not occur, and the ceremony proceeds as normal to the Agon. However, the chain cannot be torn out and the target is not prevented from taking offensive action against the leader.

*Agon:* Failure during phase three of a Geas causes a reversal of astral energies. The leader of the ceremony becomes the target for the purposes of the chain created, and vice versa. If no net hits are achieved by either side of the opposed test, the chain is created and can be used only for tearing out the chain. Using it on either one of them in that instance inflicts the effects on both.
