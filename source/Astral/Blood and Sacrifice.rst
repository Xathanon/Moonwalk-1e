Blood Magic
===========
Blood magic is a dangerous act; using pain and suffering to fuel magic, be that pain a willing sacrifice or forcibly taken. No matter the paradigm, this is indubitably symbolically linked with blood.

Blood magic consists of generating Blood Magic Points (BMP) and using the same. Generating BMP is divided into two approaches based on who you generate it from: voluntary and involuntary. Once generated, BMP fade at the end of the Action Phase (in combat) or in one minute (out of combat) unless an activity that uses them has begun.

Voluntary Approach
------------------
Voluntary blood magic is a willing sacrifice, be it of your own self or of an ally who's willing to see the pain through. Unfortunately  Using a melee weapon that doesn't use the Clubs skill, the mage must deal Physical damage to the target, which generates BMP at a rate of 1 BMP for every two boxes of Physical damage filled.

Involuntary Approach
--------------------
Involuntary blood magic is the unwilling sacrifice; normally achieved by tying people down and cutting them, it can also be done at greater risk in combat. Involuntary blood magic leaves a permanent stain on the user's soul, which can be seen in their aura. To generate blood magic points from an involuntary target, the user must be wielding a melee weapon that doesn't use the Clubs skill, and deal Physical damage to the target, which generates BMP at a rate of 1 BMP for every one box of Physical damage filled.

Mages and Blood Magic
---------------------
Mages become much more powerful when fueled by BMP. Using BMP as a mage is a Free Action that accompanies beginning another magical activity. When you begin an activity that would result in resisting Warp, you may use 1 BMP to reduce the Warp incurred by that activity before resistance by 1, to a minimum of 0. In addition, you may use BMP for the following activities to bring about the listed effects:

*For Wyrding, Runesmithing, and Creation:*

You may use 1 BMP to increase the effective Force of a spell, rune, or construct by 1, without correspondingly increasing Warp.

*For Summoning:*

You may use 1 BMP to increase the number of services gained by 1.

*For Binding and Invocation:*

You may use 1 BMP to replace 1 reagent.

**You may only use total BMP on one effect up to your Potency.**

Channelers and Blood Magic
--------------------------
Generating BMP for Channelers tends to be easier. However, their uses for it are slightly more limited. Channelers may use BMP as a Free Action to increase the effective rating of a power by 1 per BMP spent for Action Phases equal to their Somatesthesia, up to its maximum rating.

Blood Ceremonies
----------------
Blood magic contributes little to Evocation normally as above, but has a special purpose. A living, sapient person with an aura killed during the ceremony can replace the components for one phase of the ceremony. This normally results in a great number of sacrifices being lined up by aspiring blood mages who use ceremonies.
