Abjuration
==========
Abjuration consists of undoing magical effects. Whenever a magical effect is undone by Abjuration, the abjurer suffers Warp equal to the Force of the effect abjured. This Warp is physical if the Force is greater than their Potency.

Using Negation
--------------
Negation is the act of unweaving spells. 

The primary effect of Negation is known as Counterspelling; when a creature within your line of sight attempts to cast a spell and you are aware of the casting, you may use a complex interrupt to attempt to counter it. The casting roll becomes an opposed test against the abjurer's Potency + Negation [Astral]. If the abjurer succeeds, the spell does not take effect.

An abjurer may also attempt to undo an existing sustained spell within their astral line of sight; this is a Potency + Negation [Astral] test. If the abjurer scores as many hits as were scored in the casting of the spell, the spell ends immediately.

Using Diusjunction
-------------------
Disjunction is the art of unmaking magical objects created by the use of artifice.

The abjurer may touch a brew or a rune as a complex action and make a Potency + Disjunction [Astral] test with a threshold equal to the Force of the rune or Power of the brew. On a success, the target ceases to be magical, before it can activate (if it would activate on a touch from the abjurer).

An abjurer using Disjunction may also use a complex action to attempt to disrupt a talisman within their astral line of sight. They must make an opposed test using Potency + Disjunction [Astral] vs. Force + (Potency or Somatesthesia of the talisman's current owner). If they are successful, the talisman is deactivated and cannot be reactivated for a number of Action Phases equal to the abjurer's net hits.

Using Exorcism
--------------
Exorcism is all about breaking the astral constructs and summons of others.

An exorcist may use a complex action to attempt to exile a spirit within their astral line of sight. This consists of a Potency + Exorcism [Astral] vs. Force x 2 opposed test against the spirit. The spirit gains a bonus to this test equal to its binder's Potency if it is bound. On a success, the spirit is sent back to its home metaplane - if it is a summoned spirit, its former owner loses all its services. Otherwise, its owner cannot call it back again for a number of Action Phases equal to the abjurer's net hits.

An exorcist may also use a complex action to attempt to disrupt an opponent's astral construct, provided it is within their astral line of sight. The abjurer must make a Potency + Exorcism [Astral] (Force of the construct) test. On a success, the construct ceases to exist.
