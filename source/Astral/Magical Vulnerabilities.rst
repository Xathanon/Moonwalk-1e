Magical Vulnerabilities
=======================
Magic is a solution to many problems, but comes with many vulnerabilities. Magic users are vulnerable to bigger magical fish than themselves, and their own powers, in ways that mundanes can only begin to comprehend.

The Limits of Magic
===================
Magic, though powerful, is not limitless.

Warp
----
Working most kinds of active magic results in some form of Warp. Warp is the toll of exhaustion and physical stress that channeling magical energies causes. Warp is stun if the Force of the activity involved is greater than the character's Potency or Somatesthesia, or specified by the effect if there is no Force. Warp is resisted as appropriate to a mage's paradigm or with Fortitude + Willpower for channelers. Arcane channelers use each as appropriate to the source of the action taken that causes warp, using the appropriate attribute to determine whether the Warp is stun or physical, but default to their paradigm's warp resistance calculation. 

Occasionally it is needed that those not magically inclined must resist Warp. When this occurs, they resist the Warp with Fortitude + Willpower, and it is always physical damage unless otherwise specified.

Maximum Force
-------------
A mage may only cast spells, summon or bind spirits, create constructs, manufacture brews, runes, or talismans, invoke rituals, or evoke ceremonies of a Force up to twice his Potency.

Object Resistance
-----------------
Affecting objects with magic is not like affecting people. Living creatures resist some affects of magic by their force of will and other innate characteristics; objects have no such mental attributes. When determining if an effect (other than a damaging one) affects a nonliving target (including a vehicle or drone), the GM must find the Object Resistance using the following two calculations;

* Whether the target has a device rating, i.e. is a digital, matrix-active device. Even if it is currently bricked, it has a device rating in theory.

If the target has a device rating, then its object resistance is equal to two plus its device rating.

* Whether the target is a heavily tooled industrial product, such as soy food paste or a monomolecular melee weapon.

If the object does not have a device rating, consult the table below and determine its object resistance based on the primary material used for its functional components.

+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Obj. Res. | Description                                                                                              |
+===========+==========================================================================================================+
| 1         | Organic materials such as hand-worked bone, wood, or leather.                                            |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3         | Lightly processed natural materials such as personally manufactured iron or steel equipment.             |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5         | Moderately processed natural materials, such as archaic firearms or unpowered melee weapons.             |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7         | Highly-processed mechanical objects such as guns, powered melee weapons, et cetera.                      |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 10        | Anything more processed than the above that somehow doesn't have a device rating.                        |
+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Object resistance is used as a threshold in most instances where it is referenced. To surpass the object resistance of an object means to score more hits than the object resistance value as determined above. If a character is performing magic on an object they personally crafted (using the crafting rules), they reduce the object resistance by one for the purposes of their magic.

Links
=====
Links are pieces of a target. Literally. A drop of blood, a piece of skin, a fingernail, all are examples of links. Links are needed for various sorts of magic, and can be used for types of magic they aren't needed for. A link only has power while it still bears traces of its source's aura - it loses power within one hour of leaving their body. This can be prevented by a variety of means, but only if it is preserved before it loses all of its power. Note that traces of 'ware, even cyberware, also count as part of the target's body - they are incorporated into their essence, after all.

Links can also be to objects or location, in which case they must be pieces of the object or location which is being targeted, such as a piece of leather from the seat of a car being targeted, or a shaving of paint from a wall. These pieces likewise lose their power in an hour of being removed from the place of their source. Note that a link to a location must be from an integral part of the location, such as walls or floor, not mere furniture or a book from the shelf.

Using a complex action to assense an object and getting at least one net hit is more than enough to tell if it will function as a link - though being eligible to recognize their aura via that assensing test is necessary to recognize to whom the link belongs.

Sympathetic Links:
------------------
Sometimes you don't have the opportunity to use fresh blood or a lock of hair from your victim to perform magic upon them. Thankfully, most sapient creatures are quite emotional, and leave their emotions on everything they touch. Anything that a creature uses for ten minutes or more becomes slightly colored with their aura. This coloring can be used in place of a proper link, though it only lasts for as long as the last time they were using it. A sympathetic link cannot be used to target a location.

A sympathetic link cannot be used to ease any abilities that do not require the use of a link, and any ability that requires a link for which a merely sympathetic link is used suffers a -2 penalty on tests.

Astral Forms:
-------------
Any astral form that permanently has a person's astral signature counts as a valid Link to them. Using an astral form in this manner does not damage or disrupt it in any way, nor does it reduce its viability for use as a link for future instances.

Magical Failures
================
The vast majority of magic has no particular effects when failed, but Rituals and Ceremonies all have unique consequences. In addition to these consequences, GMs should feel free to get in touch with their inner genie when devising the consequences of glitches and critical glitches for the effects of Rituals and Ceremonies.

Rituals:
--------
When you fail a ritual for any reason, all participants must resist Warp as normal, and suffer a -2 penalty to all Astral Actions until the next dawn. This does not apply if the ritual was failed due to insufficient hits in the sealing step, as each participant must still resist the normal Warp under those circumstances.

Ceremonies:
-----------
When you fail a ceremony for any reason, the effects depend on the phase of the Ceremony in which it was failed. During the Praxis, the listed effects in the Ceremony's description for the Praxis occur. During the Telete, the listed effects in the Praxis occur, as well as any effect listed for the Telete. For a failure during the Agon, however, only effects listed for the Agon occur, unless otherwise stated. Regardless of when the Ceremony is failed, all participants and the leader must immediately resist the Warp value of the ceremony, in Physical Warp, instead of Stun as is normal.

Finally, a rating 2 background count is generated in the lodge where a ceremony failed, which is unaspected and cannot become aspected by any means. This background count fades in a number of days equal to the Force of the Nexus in which the Ceremony was performed..

Astral Stain
============
Astral stain is the measure of your sins against the spiritual world: how much you abuse the spirits, and how much they'll be after you. Power, after all, always has a cost. The following actions add to your Astral stain:

* Blatant disrespect of a summoned or bound spirit: +1
* Binding a free spirit, or binding any spirit without an offering: +Force
* Disruption of a free spirit: +Force
* Permanently destroying a spirit: +Force

Astral stain may be offset by making sacrifices to the spirits. Whenever you wrong a spirit, you may reduce the Astral Stain gained by up to 5 by sacrificing that many reagents to it, showing your penitence and humility in performing the action. Or just buying their silence. Your gamemaster may also determine that your actions are being made to the benefit of the spirit world, such as disrupting a toxic free spirit, in which case your action does not accrue any Astral Stain.

Whenever a spirit assenses you and achieves one or more hits, it becomes aware of your astral stain. For every 10 points of Astral Stain, you suffer a -1 penalty on all summoning tests, and all social tests made to interact with spirits who are aware of your astral stain.

Setting Things Right:
---------------------
Astral stain can grow despite one's best efforts to be respectful to the spirits - and sometimes it becomes a hindrance that is difficult to deal with. The following actions reduce your Astral stain:

* Penitence. Performance of an action appropriate to your paradigm (such as regular prayers at a shrine) can reduce your astral stain by one for every ten days of dedicated daily effort that takes at least one hour each day.
* Sacrifice. Performance of the Atonement ceremony resets your astral stain to 0.
* Reconciliation. Seeking out the spirits you have wronged and genuinely showing your sorrow (and possibly performing services to them to right the wrongs you've done to them) can remove the Astral stain you gained from them.
* Liberation. Exorcising a free spirit that has been bound decreases your astral stain by half the spirit's Force.
* Penance. At your gamemaster's discretion, actions taken in defense or on behalf of the spiritual world can decrease your astral stain.

Astral Signatures
=================
Whenever anyone performs a magical activity, an astral signature is left on the target, be that target a location or a creature, at an equal force to the originating effect. Each person has a unique astral signature. Astral signatures are auras, not astral forms. They may be assensed, as per the assensing table.

In specific, here are how astral signatures are left by each category of magical effect:
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Channeler powers                    | Any power that affects a creature other than the Channeler leaves their astral signature on that creature.                                                              |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Spells                              | A spell leaves the caster's astral signature on each target location, object, or creature, and remains on the target of a sustained spell for its duration.             |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Rituals                             | A ritual leaves the leader's astral signature on each target location, object, or creature.                                                                             |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Ceremonies                          | A ceremony leaves the astral signature of each participant on each target.                                                                                              |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Summoning                           | Any summoned spirit has its summoner's astral signature on it.                                                                                                          |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Binding                             | A bound spirit carries more of its owner's power with it. Any powers it uses also leave its binder's astral signature on their targets.                                 |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Critter Powers with the Magical tag | Leave the astral signature of the critter behind. If the power has no force, use the Force (or Potency or Somatesthesia) of the critter for the force of the signature. |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Brewing                             | A brew carries its brewer's astral signature. When it is used, an astral signature is left behind on the target at a Force equal to the brew's Power.                   |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Runesmithing                        | A rune carries its smith's astral signature. When it is activated, it leaves behind that astral signature as a spell.                                                   |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Talismans and Magical Equipment     | Carry their owner's astral signature at all times. Talismans also carry their maker's astral signature at all times.                                                    |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The Force of an astral signature created by an effect that is not ongoing is reduced by one every hour. When it is reduced to 0, it ceases to exist.
