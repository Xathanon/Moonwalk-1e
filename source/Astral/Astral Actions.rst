Astral Actions
==============
Astral actions are actions that do not rely on any sort of physical movement or action - while performing physical actions such as chanting or making gestures may assist one in concentration, no such physical motion is needed.

All astral actions count as magical activities for any other instances of that keyword, but are not the only kind of magical activities; binding, brewing, ceremonies, rituals, runesmithing, and various actions provided by metamagics are also magical activities. Some may even be astral actions, but are not listed here because of their exclusivity.

Range
-----
Some astral actions have specified ranges: those are Self, Touch, Line of Sight, Astral Line of Sight, and certain exceptional values.

* Self can target only onesself, and no one else.
* Touch requires a physical touch from the character's aura - this means that it can be done through clothes or armor, but against an unwilling target, an astral action with a range of touch requires an attack using the Unarmed skill, as part of the action. If the attack hits, the astral action continues as normal.
* Line of Sight functions as described under :doc:`Source/Core/Senses`. Any action that targets astral forms specifically requires Astral Line of Sight.
* Exceptional range values are specified in their entries.

Effect
------
Some effects are astral, and some are terrestrial. Which they are determines the functioning of the line of effect for the action.

* Terrestrial Line of Effect cannot pass through physical objects, but can pass through astral forms freely.
* Astral Line of Effect cannot pass through astral forms, but can pass through physical objects freely.

All astral actions use the Astral Line of Effect except spells that specify otherwise (see :doc:`Sorcery/Spellcasting`)

Astral Anchors
--------------
Several astral actions produce effects that are 'anchored.' 

An effect may be anchored to one of two things: an aura or a point in space relative to the earth (it rotates with the earth, but does not move relative to anything else). If an effect is anchored to an aura, it moves with that aura. If an effect is anchored to a point in space, it remains there. Any anchored effect is an astral form. 

If the effect is anchored to an aura, that astral form is woven into the creature's aura, but may still be disrupted by astral intersection if the creature passes through another astral form. If a creature to which a spell is anchored dies, the effect ends early.

If the effect is anchored to a point, that point is the location of the astral form.

Even if the effect affects an area, the anchor's astral form is only a single point.

Repetition Notice
-----------------
Actions listed here are repeated from the various places where they are specifically discussed. Any information present in those specific locations overwrites any errors present in this section.

Action List
===========
Actions are formatted as follows:

Action
------
Action Type, Range, Effect, Test

Range

Description

De/Activate a Power
----------------
Variable, Variable, Variable, Variable

Activating or deactivating a channeler power is an astral action at heart; using the activated power may require physical activity as well (as specified by the power) but merely activating it is an astral action. Powers that are passive require only a free action to activate or deactivate.

Astrally Perceive
-----------------
Simple Action, Self, No Test

Activating astral perception grants the actor the [Dual-Natured] trait, and all the effects that come with it. Astral perception can only be taken by mages by default; channelers and arcane channelers must purchase the appropriate power to astrally perceive.

Astrally Project
----------------
Complex Action, Self, No Test

Activating astral projection causes one to become unconscious. However, one's soul leaves one's body, becoming a separate entity with the [Astral Essence] trait and all that entails.

Cast
----
Complex Action, Variable, Wyrding + Potency [Force] vs. Variable

Casting a spell is a complex action; the opposed test, if any, as well as the effects, depend on the spell, as does the range (though it is normally either line of sight or astral line of sight.

Command
-------
Simple Action, Variable, None

Command is the action used to command summoned and bound spirits. Each time it is taken, the spirit loses one service owed to the actor. The range of this action is the same range of the spirit-summoner link.

Counterspell
------------
Complex Interrupt, Line of Sight, Negation + Potency [Astral] vs. Wyrding + Potency [Force]

Countering a spell is a complex interrupt taken when a creature within your astral line of sight attempts to cast one; their casting test becomes first opposed by your Negation + Potency test, which if successful, completely negates the spell being cast. Net hits scored on the casting test count towards the normal use of the spell.

Create
------
Complex Action, Line of Sight, Creation + Potency [Force]

Creating an astral construct is always a complex action; the Force and hits on the Creation test are both used in different ways depending on whether the construct is to be a weapon, armor, or another object.

De/Activate
-----------
Simple Action, Exceptional, No Test

Activating or deactivating a talisman is a simple action, and can only be taken on talismans that are bound to onesself regardless of distance or ability to perceive exact locationi. While active, a talisman is an astral form that bears its owners astral signature, as well as its maker's.

Disjoin
-------
Complex Action, Touch, Disjunction + Potency [Astral] (Force)

The basic use of the Disjunction skill, this ability deactivates a rune or brew touched by the user.

Disable
-------
Complex Action, Line of Sight, Disjunction + Potency [Astral] vs. Force + (Somatesthesia or Potency of the owner)

A more advanced use of Disjunction, this action deactivates the targeted talisman (as if with the De/Activate action) and prevents it from being reactivated with the same for a number of Action Phases equal to the abjurer's net hits. This action exclusively targets the astral form of the talisman.

Exorcize
--------
Complex Action, Line of Sight, Exorcism + Potency [Astral] vs. Force x 2

This action attempts to cast out a spirit; if it is successful, the spirit is sent back to its home metaplane. Spirits that are not bound are freed from all services by this action, whereas bound spirits are simply prevented from being called back to the summoner for a number of Action Phases equal to the actor's net hits.

Negate
------
Complex Action, Line of Sight, Negation + Potency [Astral] (Hits on the casting test)

The abjurer attempts to undo a sustained spell. If they succeed on the negation test, the spell ends immediately.

Summon
------
Complex Action, Line of Sight, Summoning + Potency [Astral] vs. Force x 2

The actor attempts to summon a spirit available to their paradigm. If successful, the spirit appears at a chosen location within range, summoned from a metaplane. The spirit owes services to the summoner equal to their net hits.

Trigger
-------
Simple Action, Line of Sight, No Test

The artificer activates a rune that they have prepared with the Command trigger. The rune then makes an Energy + Force [Force] test to cast the spell with which it was made, on a target of the activator's choosing (at the time of activation).

Unmake
------
Complex Action, Line of Sight, Disjunction + Potency [Astral] (Force)

The actor attempts to unmake an astral construct built with the Creation skill. If they are successful, the construct ceases to exist. This action exclusively targets astral forms.

Use BMP
-------
Free Action, Self, No Test

If one has come by BMP, one may use them with a free action; they then augment one's next magical activity on the same turn, as appropriate to their use. See :doc:`Blood and Sacrifice`
