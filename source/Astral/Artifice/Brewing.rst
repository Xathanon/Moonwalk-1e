Brewing
=======
Brewing is a lengthy process that creates liquids that grant potent magical effects when drunk or poured out on objects or creatures. Creating a brew requires taking the following steps:

* **Select Brew.** You must have a brew known in order to make that brew.
* **Prepare the Lodge.** You may only make brews in a lodge appropriate to your tradition. This step includes getting out the appropriate containers and non-magical ingredients as appropriate to your paradigm.
* **Choose the Power.** You must declare the Force of the brew to be made. Some brews have a minimum Force; others simply use Force for some calculation or other.
* **Mix the Brew.** You may use a number of reagents of your paradigm up to the Force of your lodge to create a brew, mixed in with liquids appropriate to the brew itself and your paradigm. The number of reagents used is the Power of the brew. Mixing the Brew takes thirty minutes per reagent used.
* **Invoke the Brew.** You make a Brewing + Potency [Number of reagents used] (Force) test. If this test is a failure, the brew is worthless magical sludge.
* **Resist Warp.** You must resist Warp equal to twice the Force of the brew. You must resist this Warp regardless of the success or failure of the brewing process.

Completed brews last until they are used. What their Force and Power do is highly variable and dependent on the specific brew. Each Brew has a vector, meaning how it may be administered to its target, and several have a minimum Force.

Learning Brews
--------------
Learning a brew requires either a copy of its formula or a teacher who knows the brew. A teacher provides a teamwork test for the learning test. The learning test is a Logic + Arcana [Mental] (5, 1 day) extended test. If this test is successfully completed, the mage may spend BP equal to the brewing threshold to learn the brew.

Brew Listing
============
Brews are listed in the following format:

Anointment
----------

Anointment is short for a variety of anointing brews. When the brew is made, the brew's purpose must be decided upon; using it for any other purpose immediately fails and ruins the brew. Uses for anointment specifically cite it.

Brew of Swiftness

---------------
Contact (N/A)

This difficult and complex brew repairs nonmagical physical objects well, but not living things. When it is poured onto a damaged object, that object removes a number of boxes from its physical condition monitor equal to the Force of the brew. In the case of damaged magical objects, it can restore the physical object, but restores no lost magic to an object. The liquid can magically replace small amounts of lost material, but cannot replace entire missing parts of mechanisms, or replace more material than the brew's Force in cubic centimeters.

In order for the Brew of Mending to be effective, the Power of the brew must be equal to or greater than the target's Object Resistance.

They use the Force of the brew as the Force of the spell, and make the casting test with Willpower + Power [Force] instead Wyrding.
