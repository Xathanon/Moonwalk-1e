Enchantment
===========

Enchantment is the art of permanently hooking magical energy into an object to serve as a equipment in performing further magic. Uses of enchantment in normal crafting are handled in the rules for crafting; however, since talismans are a special case, they will be detailed here instead. Creating a talisman requires the following steps:

* **Acquire the formula.** Creating any type of talisman requires a formula appropriate to its type and Force. Formulae for talismans can be crafted (using normal crafting rules) or acquired.
* **Acquire the telesma.** When creating a talisman, you must place a great deal of magical energy into a single object. Making this object yourself is a common practice, as it eases the process of enchantment. Either way, the telesma is the object to become the physical portion of the talisman.
* **Prepare the lodge.** You may only craft talismans within a lodge you own, and its force must be equal to or greater than the Force of the formula.
* **Inscribe the telesma.** This step is often steeped in ritual appropriate to one's paradigm, but consists in effect of, loop by loop, weaving your own astral energies into the telesma. This step takes a number of hours equal to the Force of the formula.
* **Invoke the telesma.** This step is the crucial part. You must make an Enchantment + Potency [Force of your lodge] (object resistance threshold of the telesma) test. The enchanter may then spend an amount of BP up to the lower of their net hits or the Force of the formula. The final Force of the talisman is equal to the number of BP spent.
* **Resist Warp.** You must resist warp equal to twice the Force of the formula. This is stun by default, but becomes physical if the Force of the formula is greater than the enchanter's Potency.
* **Bind the talisman.** This step is entirely optional. If you have made a talisman for yourself, you or another individual whom you have personally crafted it for and who was present during the crafting process may bind it as soon as it is completed. If it is bound this way, a talisman's binding cost is reduced by the build points spent to create the talisman.

The completed talisman's exact effects are determined by its type, subtype, and Force, and bear their maker's astral signature on them at all times.

Talismans
=========
Talismans can become the very heart of a mage's magical capabilities, and can amplify the power of a channeler. Talismans can be activated with a simple action, and deactivated with a free action. Their bonuses only apply while they are active (obviously), and while active, they have an astral form.

Binding a talisman costs BP equal to twice its Force, and permanently places the owner's astral signature on it. If multiple talismans would apply a bonus to the same test, only the talisman of the highest Force applies.

Channeling Talismans
--------------------
Only Channelers and Arcane Channelers can bind to channeling talismans. Each point of Force allows the Channeler to access a quarter of a power point, which at the time of binding must be dedicated to a specific power; once this power is selected, the talisman's power points can only be used for that power, unless it is rebound.

Power Talismans
---------------
Power talismans are subtyped for each magical skill other than Enchantment; that is, for Binding, Brewing, Creation, Disjunction, Evocation, Exorcism, Invocation, Negation, Runesmithing, Summoning, and Wyrding. Only Mages and Arcane Channelers can bind power talismans.

Telesmic Weapons
----------------
The most feared equipment of a channeler is a telesmic weapon, but even a mage can bind to one. A telesmic weapon applies its bonus to all melee attacks made with the weapon.

Arcane Talismans
----------------
These talismans do not give a bonus to tests (directly). Instead, each Arcane Talisman is tied to a specific Art. For metamagics within that Art, a character using an Arcane Talisman related to that art treats their Ascension Degree as if it were increased by the Arcane Talisman's Force.
