Runesmithing
============
Runesmithing is a temporary, but versatile form of magical energy storage. Each paradigm uses its own form of runes, glyphs, or other markings for runesmithing, but the effect is in the end the same.

To smith a rune, you must take the following steps:

* **Gather the lynchpin.** You must select an object upon which to inscribe the rune, which acts as the source of the spell.
* **Declare Force.** You must select a Force for your rune. The maximum Force of any rune you smith is twice your Potency.
* **Choose trigger.** You must select a trigger for the rune, as listed below. This determines when and how it activates.
* **Inscribe the rune.** In time-honored traditions of your paradigm, you place a marking on the lynchpin. This step takes one minute per Force of the rune.
* **Invoke the rune.** You seal the rune's power by making a Runesmithing + Potency [Force] (Force/2) test. If you succeed, the net hits on your test become the rune's Energy.
* **Resist Warp.** You must resist Warp, calculated as if casting the spell of the rune at the same force, plus any modifiers for triggers.

Upon completion, a new rune has Energy and Force stats, which, when it is activated, cast the spell in place of a spellcaster, using Energy in the place of Wyrding and Force in the place of Potency. Runes with a sustained duration sustain themselves for minutes equal to their Energy.

Runes do not maintain their energy indefinitely. After a number of hours equal to a rune's Energy, it begins losing one point of Energy per hour. If a rune loses all of its Energy, it ceases to be magical.

Runes are clearly magical to even mundane vision, or at least look like the very fanciest of LEDs. Runes have auras, but not astral forms. When a rune is activated, it becomes an astral form for the duration of the spell.

Learning Runes
--------------
In order to craft runes, you must learn runes. There is one corresponding rune for each spell, which goes by the same name. These runes have identical effects to their spell counterparts.

Learning a rune requires either a teacher or a runic formula. Runic formulae may be crafted (see crafting). A teacher provides a teamwork test for the learning test. The learning test for a rune is a Logic + Arcana [Mental] (5, 1 day) extended test. If this test is successfully completed, the mage may spend 5 BP to learn the new rune.

Triggers
========
All runes require a trigger; that is, a preset condition that causes the rune's power to activate. This is set on the rune's creation.

Command:
--------
This rune can be activated only by its creator taking a simple action while they have line of sight to it. The creator may activate it while having only astral line of sight to its aura, if they wish. The creator then chooses a valid target for the spell, as normal, and the rune activates.

This trigger adds +2 Warp to the runesmithing process.

Time:
-----
A rune with the Time trigger goes off a set amount of time after its creation. This time is set by the creator, and can be any precise amount of time up to the creator's Potency in days. Note for long time intervals that the rune may lose its power before it goes off if it has insufficient Energy. If the rune requires a target, it targets the nearest living aura within range, or the nearest aura period within range if nothing living is available. If there are no auras available, the rune fizzles out.

This trigger adds no Warp to the runesmithing process.

Contact:
--------
A rune with the Contact trigger goes off as soon as it is touched by any living creature's aura. Note that this includes merely grazing their armor - it might be just as well called an aura proximity trigger. Runes that would normally use the casting roll as an attack do not permit an attempt to dodge. Runes with a range of touch are already considered in contact with their target. These runes always target the creature that activated them.

This trigger adds +1 Warp to the runesmithing process.

Destruction:
------------
This rune is activated when the object upon which it is inscribed is destroyed, such as when a window is broken or a car crashes. The object's physical condition monitor must be completely filled. If the spell requires a target, it targets whatever destroyed the object.

This trigger adds +1 Warp to the runesmithing process.
