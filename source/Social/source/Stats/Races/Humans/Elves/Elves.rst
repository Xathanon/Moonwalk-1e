Elves:
======
Elves are slightly taller than humans, and have a pointed aural helix that is their greatest apparent distinguishing factor. They also tend to be more appealing and able to move faster due to their elongated physiology. Elves form roughly 15% of the global sapient population of Earth, and mature slightly slower than normal humans, reaching maturity around the age of 27. Their maximum lifespans are undocumented, but projected to reach roughly five hundred years, at least, and no one has ever seen an "old" elf. 

Elves tend to be fully blended into whatever human cultures they find themselves in, with the exception being Elvhanan, a highly exclusive and isolationist nation of elves that occupies the island that used to be known as Ireland.
