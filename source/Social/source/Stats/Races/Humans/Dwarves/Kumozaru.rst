Kumozaru:
=========
Kumozaru came about when other subraces of humanity began appearing in Japan, a special subrace of dwarf that bears more than a passing semblance to a spider monkey - hence the name - including a long, prehensile tail. As with all other subraces that appeared in Japan, the Kumozaru were widely abused and cast out of society. Kumozaru mature much faster than normal humans, reaching full maturity around 15, and are expected to have a maximum lifespan of around 80 years.

Kumozaru in time formed their own enclaves in the widely abandoned mountains in Japan, until the Archdragon Thryothrin came to dominate there. These enclaves have become global wanderers, not truly welcome in any societies - hence why a fair number of them are in UDP communities. Even there, they tend towards rebellion and individuality as a cultural whole.
