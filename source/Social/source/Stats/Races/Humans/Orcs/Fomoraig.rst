Fomoraig:
=========
Fomoraig are dark and looming figures, towering above their fellow orcs, normally around two meters tall. Rarely born and only from orcs, Fomori are often brought to positions of leadership in orc cultures by their natural talents. Despite their towering figures, their mental capabilities tend to be well above their fellow orcs. They mature similarly to orcs, but live twice as long.

Fomoraig are few and far between, not true-breeding and not common enough to form communities of their own, instead normally being part of a larger orcish culture.
