==========
Qualities are just that special something that make some people just downright different from others. Some provide generally beneficial effects, and others provide generally negative ones; thus they are divided into positive and negative qualities. For more on the effects of positive and negative qualities on Build Points, see :doc:`source/core/Build Points`.

Qualities are also sorted into types as traits are, into magical, mental, physical, and digital. There are also certain tags that are applied to certain qualities, listed in square brackets [like this] next to the name of the quality.
