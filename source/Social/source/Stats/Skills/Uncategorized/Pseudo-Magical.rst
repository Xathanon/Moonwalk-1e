Pseudo-Magical Skills (Uncategorized):
======================================
Pseudo-Magical skills are related to magical skills, but unlike normal magical skills, they have their own unique prerequisites.

Arcana (Logic):
---------------
Arcana is one's measure of practical arcane knowledge; while it outlines a basic understanding of most magical topics, it includes only the knowledge of how they function and most importantly, how to replicate them. Any creature can take the Arcana skill as a study of abstract magic, but few will benefit from it.

Assensing (Intuition):
----------------------
Assensing is the art of specifically analyzing and understanding what is visible about things in the astral world. Any creature that can in any way gain the [Dual-Natured] trait can train in Assensing.

Translocation (Intuition):

Translocation is the complicated act of moving one's spirit as propelled only by one's will. Translocation can be taken only by creatures who have or can gain the [Astral Essence] trait.
