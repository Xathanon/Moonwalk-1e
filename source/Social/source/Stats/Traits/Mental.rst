Mental Traits:
==============
Mental traits define and affect a character's cogitation. This can have widespread effects, and whether or not they're exactly physical has been debated by philosopher and neurologists for untold ages.

Positive Mental Traits:
-----------------------

*[Sapient]*
Sapience is a complex matter, and not all creatures with this trait think the same way humans do. Nonetheless, it is a general yes/no switch for the ability to abstract information and hypothesize, as well as the ability to consider ontological consequences of existence and other purely abstract logical systems.

All spirits, sprites, human races, and extrahuman races have this trait, whether it is listed for them or not, unless otherwise specified.

*[Unemotional]*
Creatures with Unemotional are immune to effects that rely on emotions to be effective. This includes all psionic spells, mana illusions, and various critter powers that rely on emotions (listed in their entries). Creatures with this trait can also never become Awakened.

Negative Mental Traits:
-----------------------

*{Psychically Alien}*
A creature that is Psychically Alien has such a massively different mindset from humans that it is difficult for it to interact with creatures that donâ€™t share its inhuman perspective. A creature with Psychically Alien suffers a -2 penalty to tests using Social skills against creatures that do not have this trait.

{Essence Loss}
A creature with Essence Loss loses one point of Essence every seven days. Normally, creatures with Essence Loss have a way to recuperate their lost essence - otherwise, their lives have a very short clock. In the event that they do, they can absorb additional essence up to a maximum of 12.

Creatures with Essence Loss only lose points from Potency, Somatesthesia, Reverb, or Depth if they the essence loss from this trait brings their maximum for such an attribute below their current attribute. If their maximum is raised back by regaining the lost essence, they regain points lost in such a way immediately. Note that this only applies to essence loss due to this trait - other sources of essence loss have more permanent effects, and also decrease the maximum essence a creature with Essence Loss can have.
