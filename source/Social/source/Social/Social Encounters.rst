Social Encounters:
==================
The majority of the time, in using social skills, it's a one-off thing; you ask a contact for a hand, or you need to B.S. your way past a security checkpoint. Sometimes, though, interacting with people isn't so simple as you asking Mr. Smith for more money and him saying no. In those circumstances, the GM may declare a social encounter. 

Social encounters are resolved in much the same way that combat is, with a few exceptions.

* First, each Action Phase is thirty seconds, not six seconds. While normal actions can be taken in social combat, taking them in a social encounter includes the time taken to make them look inconspicuous, including blending in.
* Second, the initiative score for all characters involved, including those who are in other worlds, is determined by Charisma + Intuition instead of whatever other calculation would be used.
* Third, social actions may be taken. Unless otherwise stated in its description, any social action takes a complex action to complete in a social encounter.
* Finally, social encounters end when either the party has achieved its goal, when the party leaves, or when the party is no longer able to meaningfully interact with any of the relevant NPCs.

If an action taken would start combat, or if an NPC starts combat, proceed to the combat rules.

Formality:
----------
At the beginning of any social encounter, the GM must choose a Formality Rating for the scenario, as shown on the table below:

+----------------+--------+----------+--------+---------+
| Setting        | Street | Informal | Formal | Society |
+----------------+--------+----------+--------+---------+
| Numeric Rating | 1      | 2        | 3      | 4       |
+----------------+--------+----------+--------+---------+

The Formality Rating determines the appropriate attire and whether or not it is appropriate to bring obvious weaponry, as well as determining the threshold of various social maneuvers.

Attitudes & Reputation:
-----------------------
At the start of a social encounter, the GM determines the relevant NPCs, their attitudes towards the player characters, and whether any of them know any factional reputations held by the player characters. Unless determined otherwise by the GM, an NPC's starting Attitude is Neutral. Whenever a maneuver or other effect would raise an NPC's attitude towards a character, their attitude moves one column to the right, and whenever their attitude would be lowered, it moves one column to the left.

If an NPC's Attitude towards a player character is reduced below Hostile, they will refuse to interact with them and may not be targeted with any further social actions, and the character's Awkwardness is increased by 3. If it is improved above Friendly, any goals related to earning the favor of the NPC may be considered a success.

Known Affiliation:
------------------
If a character is a known affiliate of another character, in this encounter or in general, some attitude rubs off on them. Any change to a character's attitude to an affiliated character affects their attitude towards all characters of the same affiliation, unless it would reduce their Attitude beyond Hostile or increase it above Friendly. In addition, if any affiliated characters' Awkwardness reaches three times the number of relevant NPCs in the social encounter, the entire affiliated group becomes socially irrelevant.

The Resolving Roll:
-------------------
Also at the start of a social encounter, the GM and the players should be clear as to what the goal of the social encounter is. This will help shape what the Resolving Roll is, as below.

To conclude a social encounter, one final test must be made, as in :doc:`Basic Social Tests <Social Basics>`. This is called the Resolving Roll, and the GM determines what the Resolving Roll is and when it can or must be taken.

Awkwardness:
------------
Social encounters aren't necessary without a risk of failure. In addition to potentially locking out all of the maneuvers that could produce the appropriate result by causing too many NPCs to not respond to the PCs, various results from various maneuver failures will raise a character's Awkwardness. If a character's Awkwardness reaches three times the number of relevant NPCs in the social encounter, the character becomes socially irrelevant. While socially irrelevant, no social maneuvers can be performed, and the remaining actors will respond in appropriate ways to utter rejection of the character from their social circle; this may include calling security to remove the character. The same fate can well apply to NPCs, who also suffer from Awkwardness under the same circumstances. Awkwardness of other characters and NPCs should be tracked secretly by the GM.
