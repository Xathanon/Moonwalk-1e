Diplomacy Actions:
==================
Diplomacy Actions focus on smoothing things over, removing negative modifiers, and convincing others of truths.

Defuse (C):
-----------
Required Attitude: Hostile or Negative

Defuse is the quintessential beginning of negotiating with hostile parties; this action raises the target's Attitude by one. If used in combat, and successful and plausible, the GM may declare that the combat pauses or stops to begin a social encounter.

Hob-Nob:
--------
Required Attitude: Positive or Higher

Hob-Nobbing with someone raises their Attitude by one - and best of all, can be repeated. However, once an actor fails to Hob-Nob with someone, even once, they can't use this action again against the same target in the same encounter.

Expose:
-------
Required Attitude: Neutral or Higher, or No Target

When a character has attempted a Deception action against the actor and has either failed or the deception has been discovered, they may use this action to reveal the deception to another character, in which case the character's Attitude towards the character is reduced by one. This action can be done with no target, in which case it increases the deceiver's Awkwardness by three.
