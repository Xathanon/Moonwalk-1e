Impersonation Actions:
======================
Impersonation Actions are used to mimick the exact actions and attitudes of another person, for any number of purposes. Impersonation Actions have a subject as well as a target.

Any failed Impersonation Action reduces the Attitude of the target, and any successful Impersonation Action reduces the Attitude of the subject, if they are present.

One of Them:
------------
Required Attitude: No Target

One of Them is the action used to convince an encounter that you are one of the people who belongs to a group favorable to the audience. If this action is successful, the character gains any factional reputation modifiers appropriate to the faction they are acting as a part of. If any members of the subject faction are present, they oppose this maneuver individually as if they were its target; if it succeeds against them, their attitude is not reduced. If it is, their attitude is reduced.

Mimicry:
--------
Required Attitude: Any

While a good disguise may make you appear to surface inspection to be someone else, this action is the key to impersonating a specific individual. If this action is successful, the target believes you to be whomever you are impersonating, including attitude changes as appropriate.

Mockery:
--------
Required Attitude: Positive or Higher

This action consists of mocking the behaviors of the subject to the target. If successful, the target's Attitude towards the subject is lowered by one, and the target's Attitude towards the actor is improved by one. This action cannot lower an Attitude below Hostile or increase an Attitude above Friendly.
