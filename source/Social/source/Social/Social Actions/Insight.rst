Insight Actions:
================
Insight Actions focus on spotting people, discerning their weaknesses, and figuring out their thoughts and emotions, as well as reading the situation in general.

Read the Crowd:
---------------
Required Attitude: Any

Relying on how people around the target are acting, Read the Crowd reveals the target's Awkwardness to the actor.

Pick Out:
---------
Required Attitude: No Target

This action is used to identify any specific individual in a crowd; beyond that, it counters the use of the Blend In action.

Read Motive:
------------
Required Attitude: None

This action is used to figure out the emotions of the target. Additionally, if this action achieves more net hits than the target's net hits on a Deception or Impersonation Action, the actor becomes aware of the deception.
