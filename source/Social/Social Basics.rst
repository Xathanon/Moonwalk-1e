Social Basics:
==============
Social skills are not all about fancy encounters that are extremely complex; sometimes you just need to make a baldfaced lie to get past a security checkpoint. In these instances, your GM may have you make a Basic Social Test. These are treated as social actions in terms of modifiers, but making these tests may take less than or more than a single Complex Action, at the GM's discretion. Basic Social Tests accomplish the goals described in the descriptions of social skills in a more abstract sense than a social encounter proper.

A few examples of ways in which social skills may be used in Basic Social Tests follows:

* Bargaining: Acquisition of gear, fencing gear, offering convincing bribes
* Deception: Bald-facedly lying to people, speaking half-truths
* Diplomacy: Convincing people of something you believe to be true
* Etiquette: Blending in to a social setting you don't belong to
* Impersonation: Passing as someone else to one individual
* Performance: Momentarily distracting people, providing an oration to a crowd

Basic Social Tests are opposed in a slightly different way than Social Actions are, specifically they are opposed by other skill tests.

When these tests are used as the Resolving Roll of a social encounter, a success implicates that the goal of the social encounter has been resolved positively for the actor of the Resolving Roll.
