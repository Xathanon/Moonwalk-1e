Social Actions:
===============
Social actions are actions taken in social encounters. Unless stated in their descriptions, they take a complex action.

Social actions require a target, a prerequisite attitude of the target, and an opposed test. The opposed test depends on the skill being used, as shown in the table below.

+---------------+-----------------------+
| Social Skill  | Opposed Roll          |
+===============+=======================+
| Deception     | Logic + Intuition     |
+---------------+-----------------------+
| Diplomacy     | Charisma + Willpower  |
+---------------+-----------------------+
| Etiquette     | Intuition + Willpower |
+---------------+-----------------------+
| Impersonation | Logic + Intuition     |
+---------------+-----------------------+
| Insight       | Charisma + Willpower  |
+---------------+-----------------------+
| Intimidation  | Charisma + Willpower  |
+---------------+-----------------------+
| Performance   | Logic + Willpower     |
+---------------+-----------------------+

Some social actions may state that they require no target. In these cases, the test is against a threshold of the Formality of the situation. Social actions that can be used in combat are marked with a (C) next to their name.

Social Actions and NPCs:
------------------------
NPCs cannot use social actions that change the attitude of the target on a player character - nor do they suffer or benefit from attitude or reputation modifiers when interacting with the player characters. Unless a player expressly permits an NPC to perform a social action requiring a higher attitude on them, a player character's attitude is treated as Neutral for the purposes of social action prerequisites.
