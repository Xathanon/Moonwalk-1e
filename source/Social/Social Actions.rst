Social Actions:
===============
Social actions are actions taken in social encounters. Unless stated in their descriptions, they take a complex action.

Social actions require a target, a prerequisite attitude of the target, and an opposed test. The opposed test depends on the skill being used, as shown in the table below.

Some social actions may state that they require no target. In these cases, the test is against a threshold of the Formality of the situation. Social actions that can be used in combat are marked with a (C) next to their name.

The format for a social action is as follows:

Social Actions and NPCs:
------------------------
NPCs cannot use social actions that change the attitude of the target on a player character - nor do they suffer or benefit from attitude or reputation modifiers when interacting with the player characters. Unless a player expressly permits an NPC to perform a social action requiring a higher attitude on them, a player character's attitude is treated as Neutral for the purposes of social action prerequisites.
