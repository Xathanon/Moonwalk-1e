Etiquette Actions:
==================
Etiquette Actions are those tied to blending in to an encounter's situation. This is of the utmost importance, especially in the upper levels of formality.

Break the Ice:
--------------
Required Attitude: Neutral or Lower

Break the Ice is an initiating action to show that one can be trusted and talked with in the social encounter. If it is successful, the target's attitude is raised. Each character may use this action only once on each other character in a given encounter.

Blend In:
---------
Required Attitude: No Target

Blend In is the act of slipping into the crowd and avoiding attention. In order to target you with a social action, a character must perform the Pick Out action and achieve more net hits than you achieved on this action.

Smooth Things Over:
-------------------
Required Attitude: No Target

Smooth Things Over tries to reduce your Awkwardness; more accurately, it does so, by an amount equal to the actor's net hits.
