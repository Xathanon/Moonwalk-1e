Intimidation Actions:
=====================
While in social encounters, threatening physical harm to people is normally out of the question, Intimidation still has its uses in inspiring fear of future consequences of your displeasure.

The target of an Intimidation action lowers their attitude towards the actor by one, regardless of the action's success. Remember that because Intimidation isn't a social skill, General and Individual Social Modifiers do not apply.

Loom:
-----
Required Attitude: Any

The actor presents an ominous figure at the side of someone doing actual talking. The actor provides a penalty to the target's next test made to resist a social action equal to their net hits minus the encounter's Formality.

Out of My Way:
--------------
Required Attitude: Any

The character's dark looks forbid any attempt to interfere with their actions. If successful, the target cannot use any social actions on the actor until the start of the actor's next turn.

Cut The Crap:
-------------
Required Attitude: No Target

The character decides to say, 'screw this.' If this action is successful, the encounter immediately proceeds to the Resolving Roll, unless the goal of the encounter is incompatible with such haste. If this action fails, the actor gains three Awkwardness.
