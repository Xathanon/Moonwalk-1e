Deception Actions:
====================
Deception Actions center around manipulating the beliefs of your target to falsehood, and inflicting penalties on them due to the effects this has on their behavior.

Whenever a Deception Action is failed, or a character becomes aware that they have been deceived, their Attitude towards the actor is lowered by one.

Gossip:
-------
Attitude Required: Neutral or Higher

When this action is chosen, choose a subject as well as a target, as if using an Impersonation Action. The target's attitude towards the subject is lowered by one if the action is successful. If the action is successful, the target and any onlookers also believe that the action taken was Expose.

Besmirch:
---------
Attitude Required: No Target

When this action is chosen, choose a subject as well as a target, as if using an Impersonation Action. If the action is successful, the subject can no longer benefit from any positive Reputation Modifier they may have applicable in the encounter, for the particular encounter.

Baleful Fortification:
----------------------
Attitude Required: Positive or Higher

Suffusing the target with false confidence in your lies, they gain a bonus to resist the next Expose action taken with them as the target and the actor as the deceiver.
