Performance Actions:
====================
Much as the Performance skill itself, Performance Actions are about gaining and manipulating the attention of others.

Any failed Performance Action increases the actor's Awkwardness by one.

Intercept:
----------
Required Attitude: Any

Intercept interferes with the use of another action; this action is used as a Complex Interrupt instead of a Complex Action, when another character is being targeted by a social action. If this action is successful, the target's next action must target the actor (though it needn't be the same one originally intended).

Distracting Babble:
-------------------
Required Attitude: Annoyed or Higher

Distracting Babble engages the target in small talk and interferes with their ability to work the encounter. The target cannot use any social action that requires a Complex Action on their next Turn.

Mirror, Mirror:
---------------
Required Attitude: Annoyed or Higher

Mirror, Mirror is a psychological technique involving the mimicry of the target's minute actions and utilization of this mimicry to generate a similar emotion. If this action is successful, the target's Attitude is treated as one higher for the purpose of the modifier, but not for any action prerequisites or for their attitude growing beyond Friendly.
