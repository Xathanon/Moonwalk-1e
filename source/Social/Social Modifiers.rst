General Social Modifiers:
=========================
General Social Modifiers are those few bonuses or penalties applicable to all social actions against all targets using all social skills (this does not include Intimidation or Insight maneuvers).

Outfit Formality:
-----------------
The formality of any outfit is assigned by each piece of it - if they are of mixed formality, take the average of all equipment worn, rounded down, and do the same for the social rating of all armor worn. 

The formality modifier is equal to the Social Rating of the outfit minus the absolute value of the outfit's formality minus the formality of the encounter. This applies to all social actions taken in the encounter.

Armaments:
----------
Being armed in a social situation causes certain tensions and difficulties. Any character who is visibly armed in a social encounter gains a modifier to all social modifiers equal to the Formality of the encounter minus two (this is a +1 modifier in Street formality encounters).

Individual Social Modifiers:
============================
Individual Social Modifiers apply to social actions using social skills depending on the target and their relationship to the actor.

Known Reputation:
-----------------
A character who has a reputation known by other participants in a social encounter gains a modifier based on their reputation with the target. In the instance of multiple reputations (such as the reputation of the character and the reputation of a faction they are aligned with), add up all reputation modifiers and apply the sum.

+------------+---------+---------+------+---------+------+----------+---------+
| Reputation | Opposed | Hostile | Cold | Neutral | Warm | Friendly | Aligned |
+------------+---------+---------+------+---------+------+----------+---------+
| Modifier   | -6      | -4      | -2   | 0       | +2   | +4       | +6      |
+------------+---------+---------+------+---------+------+----------+---------+

Attitude:
---------
In physical combat, if any social actions that can be attempted in physical combat are attempted on enemies, the enemy counts as Hostile. See the table below for numerical values. Note that any annoyance at a character underdressing should be counted as part of the Outfit Formality modifier.

+----------+---------+---------+----------+---------+----------+---------+----------+
| Attitude | Hostile | Annoyed | Negative | Neutral | Positive | Pleased | Friendly |
+----------+---------+---------+----------+---------+----------+---------+----------+
| Modifier | -6      | -4      | -2       | 0       | +2       | +4      | +6       |
+----------+---------+---------+----------+---------+----------+---------+----------+

Language:
---------
People are much easier to interact with when you are speaking the same language they are - and some will even respect the attempt to speak easier languages for them to understand. If you are Fluent in a character's Native language, and use it for your social actions, you gain a +2 bonus to your social actions using the Influence skill group against them. If you are Proficient, you instead gain a +1 bonus for the same actions.
