V-Ghosts:
=========
V-Ghost AI are the imprints of normal peoples who died on the Matrix. No one is quite sure how they formed - some say they are formed from free sprites taking personalities that are fully recorded in an instant of death, others say they are formed from the raw stuff of the resonance, others say the soul of the person is captured in the Matrix and may never escape to the afterlife. Whatever way you go about it, V-Ghosts normally think they are the person they are a copy of, and normally have most if not all of the person's memories.

V-Ghosts and other AI are quite rare, and while AI-friendly communities exist, AI-exclusive communities are extraordinarily rare - and if they do exist, they are likely well-hidden. AI also easily find employment as security spiders for corporations if they wish to - which they often do.
