Protominds:
===========
Protomind AI are generally the results of initial attempts from corporations at creating AI. They were successful in some respects - they managed to create sapient beings, possessed of intelligence and will. They also created Resonance entities of immense hunger. Protomind AI wander the matrix and ravage where they travel, normally in Wild Hosts, consuming data and resonant energy to sustain themselves as they internally deteriorate. More of them have occasionally been made by the mad and the unware who research the nature of AI. Protominds are nonetheless intelligent enough to understand the basics of economy, and can direct their considerable abilities in hacking and destroying matrix systems towards any number of unsavory pursuits - or even hire themselves out as guard dogs who consume intruders to legitimate hosts in exchange for a wage of fresh data to feed on.

Protomind AI occasionally hunt in packs, which are to be avoided at all costs by the sane, as are the wild hosts where protomind AI make their 'nests.'
