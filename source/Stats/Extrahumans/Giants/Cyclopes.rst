Cyclopes:
=========
Cyclops, like Minotaurs, are also only often found in the Mediterranean area. Unlike minotaurs, however, they do not outshine in mental capacity. However, they have the edge over everything else in their brute strength. Their monocular system prevents them from seeing with depth, and it's as neurological as it is physiological, so mere cybereyes cannot fix it. Some research has been done into making genetic treatments for this, but the rarity of cyclops makes it a prohibitively bad investment.

Cyclops do not have any cultures of their own, normally trying, badly, to fit in with their local cultures. At best, they end up as hired muscle.
