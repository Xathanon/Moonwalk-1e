Minotaurs:
==========
Minotaurs distinguish themselves from giants in various ways - first is that they're slightly smaller, barely ever reaching the two and a half meter height of short giants. Second, they have, to all appearances, the heads of bulls. Minotaurs nonetheless excel their larger cousins greatly in mental capability, excepting willpower.

Minotaurs are only ever seen in mediterranean areas, but have similar stigmas to those of giants. However, because they are closer together, an enclave of them has successfully formed on the island of Crete.
