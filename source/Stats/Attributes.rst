Attributes:
===========
Attributes are a key to the function of any character; a given attribute generally contributes approximately half of the dicepool for any given action. Attributes are divided into three categories, mental, physical, and special. Mental and physical attribute minimum and maximum values are determined by race or subrace, whereas special attribute boundaries are uniquely determined for the attribute. Each attribute is listed with a three-letter abbreviation that stands for it in other places in the rules.

Physical Attributes:
====================
Physical attributes are the capabilities of one's physical body, its general training and fitness in certain categories.

Strength (STR):
--------------
Strength is the measure of your character's ability to exert direct physical force. High-strength characters do more damage with most melee weapons, can compensate for much higher recoil, and can lift much heavier things.

Agility (AGI):
--------------
Agility is the measurement of one's bodily flexibility and swiftness, contributing to dodging and movement, as well as a few skills where swiftness and body control are relevant.

Dexterity (DEX):
----------------
Dexterity is the measure of a character's manual control and hand-eye coordination. It contributes to all attack rolls and several skills where swift hands and nimble fingers are needed.

Fortitude (FOR):
----------------
Fortitude is the measure of bodily durability and health. It contributes to the physical condition monitor, and almost all rolls to resist damage.

Mental Attributes:
==================
Mental attributes measure mental acuity, awareness, strength, and processing, acquired by training and inherent talent.

Logic (LOG):
------------
Logic is the measure of your character's ability to process input, perform deductive process, and otherwise utilize rational or algorithmic thought - and utilize it swiftly.

Intuition (INT):
----------------
Intuition is the measurement of one's grasp of one's surroundings and general awareness of the obvious. It contributes to defense tests as well as certain skills and resistance to some effects.

Charisma (CHA):
---------------
Charisma is the measure of a character's natural ability to influence, motivate, and deceive others; their silver tongue is in the charisma stat. It contributes almost exclusively to social and pseudo-social skills, and social initiative.

Willpower (WIL):

Willpower is the measure of mental strength; exertions of will tend to include resistance to torture and withstanding hostile magic, as well as contributing to the stun condition monitor.
