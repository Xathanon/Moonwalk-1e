Attributes:
===========
Attributes are a key to the function of any character; a given attribute generally contributes approximately half of the dicepool for any given action. Attributes are divided into three categories, mental, physical, and special. Mental and physical attribute minimum and maximum values are determined by race or subrace, whereas special attribute boundaries are uniquely determined for the attribute. Each attribute is listed with a three-letter abbreviation that stands for it in other places in the rules.
