Index of Races:
===============
As of the year 2000, humanity has been divided into races and subraces, that line up eerily well with fantasy species used in old works of fiction across the globe - now used in works of non-fictional prose across the globe. The emergence of elves and dwarves with distinct biological differences was originally thought to be some terrible experiment gone horribly wrong, but in fact was only the precursor to the beginning of the Third Cycle.

Player characters may be humans or extrahumans. Their race within these categories determines their minimums and maximums for their natural attributes, and may give them extra capabilities such as thermographic vision, or for some zany extrahumans, may change their rules entirely. Every subrace of every race other than human has a cost in build points that must be paid during the creation of the character in order to play that race.

Human Races:
------------
Human races, or humans, are a confusing category; they also include the "norm" of humanity, which is also called humans. However, because all of these categories remain able to interbreed (and often do, following the race and subrace of the same-sex parent) they are generally all considered biologically "human." To many dismay of many Tuatha.

Extrahuman Races:
-----------------
Often just called Extrahumans, these beings are of fundamental difference from humanity, in various ways. Nonetheless, they have the same basic format as the above ones.

Universal Templates:
--------------------
Universal Templates are additional templates that can be applied to human races and subraces. Their cost must be paid in addition to the cost of a proper race or subrace.
