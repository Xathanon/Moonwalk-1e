Drakes:
=======
Drakes are the creations of dragons, their servants where their claws are too large to fit and their extra hands when they need them. No one is really sure how drakes come to be, but they do.  While drakes are not universally capable of manipulating magic, those who are are in the vast majority.

Special Rules:
* A drake's attributes are determined by their "normal" human form. 
* There are four subraces of drakes, one for each type of dragon, each with their own karmic cost. In addition to that cost, you must also pay the cost of a human subrace to act as your standard form.
* Drakes differ from shifters in that their attributes remain regardless of their form, but are augmented in drake form, in addition to gaining various other handy traits. Which drake types augment which attributes and grant what traits is shown above.
* Drakes are set apart from the rest of humanity by their ability to shift into a draconic form, albeit a small one that is still roughly humanoid in shape. Shifting into a drake form is a complex action. While in their drake form, drakes have various attributes augmented by various amounts and gain additional traits as shown by their drake subrace. When they leave drake form, which takes a free action, they take stun Warp equal to the number of Action Phases they were in drake form for, which they resist with Willpower + Fortitude.
