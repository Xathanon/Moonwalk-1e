Satyrs:
=======
Far more common around the mediterranean areas and especially in greece, Satyrs forego the enhanced musculature of normal orcs for a rather increased mental capability. Satyrs also universally have remarkably hairy legs, which are hooved like a goat's and vastly increases their speed. Satyrs life short lives, living only to fifty years, but have an insatiable appetite for life, even when they are being crushed by corporate practices.

Satyrs don't particularly have any organization, but are widely expected by local folklore to be musicians - and some have turned this into a valuable source of wealth.
