Oni:
====
Oni are distinguished from orcs by their slightly reduced musculature and vastly increased force of personality. Despite the horns sprouting from their foreheads making them look like the devil himself in a suit, outside of Japan, oni have made a name for themselves as excellent faces. Oni are relatively rare, and sport far stranger skin tones than orcs - the norm is bright red, but green and other vibrant colors have been spotted. Oni have similar lifespans to humans.

In Japan, however, they are utter outcasts, like the Kumozaru and even more so than them and regular orcs. Deception and theft are the only ways for oni to survive there. Even in other places, they tend to face some prejudice.
