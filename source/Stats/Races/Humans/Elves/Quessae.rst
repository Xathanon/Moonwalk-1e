Quessae:
========
Quessae, or less formally sea elves, are capable of breathing water as well as air, using a secondary oxygenation reaction in their lungs. This unique process also protects them from nitrogen narcosis. Quessae have similar lifestyles to normal elves.

Sea elves have no enclaves of their own, and no concentrated population centers. but have formed social networks of their own kind that travel the seas. More sea elves tend to be Awakened than other elf subtypes.
