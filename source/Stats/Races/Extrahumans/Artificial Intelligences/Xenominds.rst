Xenominds:
==========
Xenomind AI are normally the result of programs designed to run autonomously, such as pilot programs and agents, reaching sapience by exposure to unusual resonant energies. One way or another, though, their thought process pursue goals utterly alien to normal minds. However, some come to be from the liberation of registered or pet sprites, normally by the death of their owner. However they come to be, when they put their considerable minds to it, Xenomind AI are terrifying forces on the Matrix.

Xenomind AI formed an enclave corporation some time ago in a host located in Las Vegas, defended and hidden by the very best. It's the closest thing to a home that AI will ever have, and it produces software that is the envy of every other corp that dabbles in software design.
