Giants:
=======
Giants are massive, towering humanoid figures, on average looming just over two and a half meters tall. Dermal deposits make their skin thick enough to reduce the impact they feel from blows and most are tough enough to ignore the average punch from the average man. Nonetheless, their massive hands are not suited for the tasks of the nimble-handed, and between the dermal deposits and the grey skin tones nearly universal to all of them, their appearance leaves much to be desired.

Giants have originated in most places, being born abnormally to human or orcish mothers who almost always perish in childbirth. Due to this, most giants have been outcasts from their societies as their births are stigmatic, and there are only rarely enough of them to form their own communities.
