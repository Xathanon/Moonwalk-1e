Sasquatches:
============
Sasquatches are only ever found in the extreme northern reaches of the world. They are especially differentiated from normal giants by their heavy coats of long, white fur, which keep them well-adapted for the cold they're adapted for. 

Due to the disastrous nature of the Aurora Borealis, their lives tend to be quite lonely, and some sprawl-dwellers might even believe they don't exist. The few civilized examples have tended to have varying levels of anti-social personality disorder.
