Special Rules: 
* Free spirits have no maximum Grit attribute after character creation, but cannot raise Grit above 6 during character creation. 
* At character creation, must choose a paradigm to which they are bound. 
* For every point of Grit they have, they may select one power from any spirit type that can be summoned by that paradigm, and treat their Grit as their Force for any effects that rely on their Force. 
* Free spirits must always gain the Mage quality, but cannot learn or use the Conjuration skill group.
* All free spirit characters gain the Realistic Form power regardless of paradigm if they gain the Materialization or Possession powers, and their physical attributes are all equal to their Grit while materialized if they have the Materialization power.
