Shapeshifters:
==============
Shapeshifters are animals who have come into Awakening in a unique way; instead of gaining additional physical prowess, they have become blessed with a (mostly) human-like form and intelligence. This makes their integration into human society difficult, as does their rarity and their value for research purposes.

Shapeshifters are highly variable, and consist of two forms, each of which has its own physical attributes - their original, animal form and their human form. Shifters come in 6 varieties, which determine their mental attributes and grit:

+------------+-------+-----------+----------+-----------+-------+
| Type       | Logic | Intuition | Charisma | Willpower | Grit  |

Special Rules: 
* The price for being a Shapeshifter must be paid, in addition to the price of the human form, as any of the human subraces shown under Humanity. 
* A shifter can freely use a complex action to change between its forms, but its Astral Form always gives away its true nature (see Assensing), and its eyes never change.
