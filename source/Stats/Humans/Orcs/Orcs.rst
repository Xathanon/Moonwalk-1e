Orcs:
=====
Orcs are born with vibrant skin tones, which range from normal human skin tones to dark greys and bright greens. Orcs form roughly 20% of the world's population - despite the prejudice and death rates and shorter lifespan, orcs give birth to their own kind in 'litters' that always have at least two children, and keep up that way. Orc lifespan maxes out around 60 years old, and the average orc reaches maturity around the age of 12.

Often sharing unfortunate appearance traits with fantasy monsters killed in scores, orcs have suffered from monstrous prejudice over their ever so slightly reduced mental capacity and definitively greater musculature. Most apparent in an average orc are the protruding tusks that escape from their mouth even when it's closed.
