Tuatha:
=======
The vanishingly rare Tuatha elves, originating only from Elvhanan, are universally magically inclined, able and constantly perceiving astral energies around them. Their physical variance from normal elves is definitive, as the other defining trait is their brilliant green hair, which stubbornly resists most attempts to dye it in any lasting way, as well as generally being yet more slender, slightly taller, but generally graceful and dextrous as well as quite superior in mind to their more common cousins. Tuatha also mature quite slower than other elves, reaching maturity around the age of forty. Projections have not been able to show their maximum lifespan, but it is likely measured in decades instead of years.

Tuatha are extremely rare outside of Elvhanan, where they hold special privileges even over the rest of the elven nation.
