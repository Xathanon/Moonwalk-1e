Svart√°lfar:
===========
Svartalfar, commonly known as dark elves, are known for their universally dark faces and white hair - which they almost always attempt to hide. While they lack the unusual charm of their more common cousins, they tend to be more manually swift as well as being universally ambidextrous. Svartalfar have similar lifespans to normal elves.

Dark elves have formed an enclave forbidden to all outsiders in the north of what used to be Norway, centered around the city of Alta, called Skogarheim. Dark elves are almost exclusively born in the scandanavian peninsula, and most elves born in that region are dark elves.
