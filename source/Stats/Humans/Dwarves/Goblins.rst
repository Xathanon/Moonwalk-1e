Goblins:
========
Distinguished physically from normal dwarves with greenish skin and exceptionally long noses, goblins in legend have a knack for cruelty. In reality, no such generality exists, but people hold goblins to the stereotype anyway. Regular IQ testing places goblins slightly ahead of the average of humanity, and their long fingers are more suited to subtle tasks than most. Goblins age prodigiously quickly, however, and it is a rare goblin who lives longer than 50 years, after reaching maturity around age 10.

Goblins began popping up everywhere, but especially centralized in Germany and Skandanavia. In no place are goblins more despised than Skoggarheim, for reasons still not revealed by the nation of dark elves.
