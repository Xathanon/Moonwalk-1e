Gnomes:
=======
Gnomes are tiny, even for dwarves, and have none of the increased breadth that tends to give dwarves a similar volume to humanity. Despite their wispy forms, gnomes have been associated with luck and craft, and in fact excel at just those things. It's a rare gnome who has to turn to the lonely path of a Moonwalker, but one who does is prized in the community. Gnomes have similar lifespans to dwarves.

Gnomes suffered by far the least prejudice of most of any dwarf subtype, and are even able to participate in the network of standard dwarves with only minor difficulty.
