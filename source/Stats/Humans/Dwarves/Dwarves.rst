Dwarves:
========
Dwarves are short, stockier humans. Their increased reserves of keratin means that most dwarves, including some females, develop very full beards, which are often used as a central derogatory term for dwarves when it is sought after. Dwarves are also possessed of increased durability and raw musculature, containing more force in their small bodies than normal humans on average. Finally, they are unusually resistant to diseases and poison, and can see based on heat instead of light as needed. Dwarves mature only slightly slower than humans, reaching maturity around 25 and are projected to live around 150 years.

Dwarves do not have a nationality, as they blend in well with regular cultures, but there is a complex social network of dwarves that includes all standard dwarves and some dwarves of other metatypes. This network is distinguished by its use of the rediscovered Dwarvish language, Thondur. Dwarves form roughly 15% of the population of the world.
