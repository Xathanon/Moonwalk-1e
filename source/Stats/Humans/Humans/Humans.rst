Humans:
=======
Humans are the bread and butter of the world population, forming about 40% of sapient beings on the planet. The 'average' against which everyone else is measured, but also the haven of a healthy number of purists who believe other races of humans to be beneath them.

Humans are highly varied in cultural norms and physical appearances, depending on their region of origin and heritage. The only thing they really have exceptionally is that spark of success. Or at least, so they think.
