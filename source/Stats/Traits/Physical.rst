Physical Traits:
================
Physical traits manifest and affect the physical world. Only creatures that have a physical body can have physical traits; they do not function in non-physical worlds (e.g. a creature with a Bane does not suffer the effect from virtually simulated instances of its weakness).

Positive Physical Traits:
-------------------------

*[Low-Light Vision]*

Characters with this trait treat darkness modifiers as if they were one level less severe, unless they are Total.

*[Ambidextrous]*

Characters with this trait suffer from no off-hand penalty, regardless of how many hands they have or are using.

*[Sense (Sense, Precision, Range)]*

Characters with a Sense are able to perceive the world through an additional lens, each of which has its own modifiers. Senses may be precise or imprecise. Each sense has a range band for its imprecise and precise modes (see Senses). Note that these ranges are for perceiving standard things; perceiving exceptional artifacts such as great flashes of light or the sound of gunfire may be possible at greater distances.

| Visual           | 1km                | 10km                 | Vision relies on light waves/particles reflected off of surfaces to give information about 'color' and 'texture.'                                 |
+------------------+--------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Auditory         | 20m                | 4m                   | Hearing relies on a specific spectrum of airwave vibrations known as the 'audible spectrum' to determine location and movement.                   |
+------------------+--------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Tactile          | Touch              | Touch                | Tactile sense is based on relative pressure across different points on a surface.                                                                 |

| Thermal          | 1km                | 10m                  | Thermal uses infrared light radiated from warm objects to determine the shapes and sizes of things by relative heat production.                   |
+------------------+--------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Sonar/Ultrasound | N/A                | 20m                  | Sonar and Ultrasound use precise sound frequencies outside the range of hearing of most living things to formulate a sense of oneâ€™s surroundings. |
+------------------+--------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Gustatory        | Touch              | Touch                | The gustatory sense is the use of reactive chemical sensors to analyze the composition of an object being 'tasted.'                               |
+------------------+--------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Olfactory        | N/A                | 20m                  | Smell is a sense that detects certain particles transmitted through the air by wind, fans, etc.                                                   |
+------------------+--------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Radar            | 20m                | 4m                   | Radar uses electromagnetic waves to detect and triangulate the locations and sometimes shapes and sizes of objects.                               |
+------------------+--------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Astral Sense     | *                  | *                    | Astral Sense detects the magical energies of the local environment, which are present in all things, to render one's surroundings.                |
+------------------+--------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
* Astral Sense uses the longest available ranges of the character's precise or imprecise senses not provided by gear that was not paid for with essence. Any [Sense] trait that grants Astral Sense is a magical trait, not a physical one.

*[Resistance to {Source} (X)]*

Creatures with a Resistance gain a bonus equal to the amount specified to resistance tests against a specific effect or type of effects.

*[Speed (Type, X)]*

Creatures with the Speed trait go fast. The specified movement mode multiplier is increased by X. For example, a creature with Speed (Walk, 1) walks Agility x 3 meters per Turn.

*[Inherent Armor (X)]*

Creatures with Inherent Armor have tough skin, dermal plates, hardened scales, you name it. They gain an extra amount of armor as specified, which stacks with all worn armor and does not count towards encumbrance. Different sources of this trait stack with each other, but a creature can benefit from no more than its Fortitude in inherent armor.

*[Extra Movement Type (Type)]*

A creature with an Extra Movement Type gains access to an additional type of movement. In a few instances, this may count as a magical trait. See Movement.

*[Element Form (Element)]*

A creature with Element Form has, at the very least, an outermost layer of their body composed entirely of an elemental energy. Anything that touches the creature or successfully hits it with a melee attack must resist an amount of physical damage of the appropriate elemental damage type equal to the creature's Potency. The creature's Potency is also added to the damage of its unarmed attacks, which count as the appropriate elemental damage type.

*[Enhanced Sense (Sense, X)]*

Sometimes just being precise isn't good enough. A creature with this trait gains a bonus to its perception tests using the specified sense equal to X.

*[Camouflaged (Sense, X)]*

A character with this trait inflicts a penalty equal to X on perception tests made to spot them using the specified sense.

*[Damage Reduction (X)]*

This extremely rare trait reduces damage taken directly. After a resistance test is made with Fortitude + Armor, reduce the amount of boxes filled by X. This only applies to damage that is resisted with Fortitude + Armor. Damage dealt using a source to which the creature has a {Weakness} ignores this trait.

*[Natural Venom (Toxin, Attack)]*

A creature with this trait has a natural venom that it excretes onto a specific attack. The toxin listed must be a contact or injection vector toxin, and it is applied on every attack made with the natural weapon as per normal rules for its vector.

*[Natural Weapon (X, Y, Z)]*

A creature with a Natural Weapon is capable of dealing deadly damage using only the armaments bestowed on it by nature. Natural weapons are melee weapons that always count as being wielded with a base damage of X, AP equal to Y, and reach equal to Z. Natural weapons deal Physical damage unless otherwise specified.

*[Liquiform]*

A creature with liquiform can reconfigure its body as a liquid, fitting through any porous substance or squeezing through any crack through which the largest solid part of its body can fit - if there even are any solid parts of its body, there normally aren't.

*[Immunity (Effect)]*

This ability is shorthand for three special immunities:

* [Immunity (Age)] means that a thing suffers no ill effects due to time - even extreme amounts of time. In living creatures, it means that as long as they aren't killed by other means, they won't die of old age.
* [Immunity (Toxins or Diseases)] means that a thing is immune to all diseases or toxins. It may still be a carrier for diseases and may often wield toxins to inflict on enemies, but it can't be effected by them.
* [Immunity (Element)] means that a thing is immune to a specific elemental damage type. Any damage taken with that elemental tag is reduced to 0, with no resistance test necessary whatsoever.

Negative Physical Traits:
-------------------------

*{Increased Lifestyle Cost (X)}*

A character with Increased Lifestyle Cost has unusual costs of living, such as having to pay for things to be differently sized or adjusted for unique physiological needs. They must pay X% more for their lifestyle, after all other adjustments have been made to its cost.

*{Distinctive (1, 2, or 3)}*

While being Distinctive may help you stand out in the normal world, for a Moonwalker, standing out is a terrible idea.

* Distinctive 1 means you stand out in a visible, but not uncommon way.
* Distinctive 2 means you stand out in being unusually visible in a way that isnâ€™t common.
* Distinctive 3 means you stand out visually due to some exceedingly rare effect or subrace.

Others who are seeking you or remembering you gain a bonus equal to your level of Distinctive to relevant tests.

*{Hindered Sense (Sense)}*

A Hindered Sense has some complication with it that reduces its functionality. No matter the cause, any Perception tests using the specified sense suffer a -2 penalty.

*{Nocturnal}*

Nocturnal creatures and characters have a natural circadian rhythm that is disturbed during daylight hours. Under natural light levels brighter than dim light, they suffer a -1 penalty to all actions.

*{Imprecise Sense (Sense)}*

A creature with this trait has lost the precision of one of its senses. Most commonly, people who are mostly blind (but not completely) have imprecise vision instead of precise vision.

*{Weakness (Source, X)}*

This trait is the negative counterpart to Resistance - any rolls made by anything with this trait to resist effects that fall under a certain type or category suffer a negative modifier equal to X.

*{Slowness (Type, X)}*

This trait reduces one's movement multiplier by X for the specified movement type. If a movement multiplier is reduced to 0, the character cannot use that movement type.

*{Bane (Source, X)}*

A creature with a Bane takes constant damage while exposed to its bane. The creature takes XP at the end of each Turn in which it has been exposed to its Bane, resisted only be Fortitude.
