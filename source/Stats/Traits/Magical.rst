Magical Traits:
===============
Magical traits affect one's aura, soul, and/or magical capabilities. Normally they are only present to the Awakened, but occasionally others have access to them.

Positive Magical Traits:
------------------------

*[Dual-Natured]*
Characters with this trait can see the astral energies of the world overlaid over the physical, and likewise their aura is instead an astral form, which moves with and in their body. Characters that become dual-natured temporarily (such as through Astral Perception) suffer a -2 penalty to all physical tests while [Dual-Natured].

[Dual-Natured] creatures may use any physical actions they satisfy the prerequisites for on a given plane on that plane, regardless of whether it is physical or astral. They do not convert their attributes like astral essences do when performing physical actions on the astral, except that they use Charisma in place of Strength when determining melee damage dealt on the astral.

Creatures that have [Dual-Natured] gain [Sense (Astral Sense, Precise, Standard)]

*[Drake]*
Drakes are set apart from the rest of humanity by their ability to shift into a draconic form, albeit a small one that is still mostly humanoid. Shifting into a drake form is a complex action. While in their drake form, drakes have various attributes augmented by various amounts and gain additional traits as shown by their drake subrace. When they leave drake form, which takes a free action, they take stun Warp equal to the amount of Turns they were in drake form for, which they resist with Willpower + Fortitude.

*[Astral Essence]*
Humans and whatnot are all normally physical forms, but having this trait means that you are an astral form with no physical body at the moment, simply a soul floating around in the astral world, astral sea, or beyond unto metaplanes. An Astral Essence can only be affected by effects in the astral world - astral spells cast in the astral and other astral forms. They may perform any physical action using their astral form - these are physical actions on the astral plane.

A being with the Astral Essence trait uses the following conversion table to determine its effective physical attributes for physical actions on the astral:

========= =========
Physical  Mental
========= =========
Strength  Charisma
Agility   Intuition
Dexterity Logic
Fortitude Willpower

Creatures that have [Astral Essence] gain [Sense (Astral Sense, Precise, Standard)] and are deprived of all other [Sense] traits.

*[Restless]*
A spirit with the Restless trait adds its force to tests it makes to resist being bound, or branded.

*[Inherent Astral Armor (X)]*
Creatures with inherent astral armor are more difficult to damage than normal. They gain an extra amount of astral armor as specified, which stacks with any other sources of astral armor. All sources of inherent astral armor stack, but a creature can only benefit from an amount of inherent astral armor up to its Willpower.

*[Awakened]*
An entity that is Awakened always has either a Potency or Somatesthesia attribute, or it loses the Awakened tag. Awakened are not creatures that are merely astrally aware or have minor magic inherent to their being, but rather are creatures that can manipulate mana in advanced techniques, such as spirits, extrahuman magicians, and dragons. This tag may be detected by assensing.
