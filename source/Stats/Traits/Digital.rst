Digital Traits:
===============
Digital traits affect one's use of the Matrix; normally these are restricted to AI, technomancers, or other matrix entities.

Positive Digital Traits:
------------------------

*[Munger]*
To Munge... that is never a question for entities with this trait. Munging is the process of consuming a form of data, including device firmware, down to its roots to fuel the code of a protomind AI or similar entity. That which is consumed is gone, forever. See the Munge depth action for details.

*[Emerged]*
Emerged creatures are those who have been touched by the Resonance. A creature may not be both Emerged and Awakened at once. Any Emerged creature has a Reverb attribute, and if it loses that, it loses the Emerged trait. Not all emerged creatures are capable of everything a technomancer is, but all technomancers are Emerged.
