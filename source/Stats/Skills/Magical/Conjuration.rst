Conjuration Skills (Magical):
=============================
Conjuration skills are those used to call forth spirits and astral constructs into one's service and keep them in your service. Different mages have different approaches to conjuration, normally heavily impacted by their paradigm.

Binding (Potency):
------------------
Binding is the skill of anchoring spirits to your essence, granting them a longer stay on this world and forcing them to your service. This is often, but not always, accompanied by an offering to avoid Astral Stain.

* Specializations: Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Beast, Humanity, Plant, Task, Guidance, Guardian

Creation (Potency):
-------------------
Creation is the skill of forging mana in the astral world into astral forms, willing them into existence to serve as tools in the ether.

* Specializations: Armor, Objects, Weapons

Summoning (Potency):
--------------------
Summoning is the act of merely pulling forth spirits from the astral world towards the gaiasphere and the summoner. Most spirits will also aid the summoner simply in exchange for seeing a bit of the world, in the short term, but the link is weak.
