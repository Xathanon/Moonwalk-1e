Conjuration Skills (Magical):
=============================
Conjuration skills are those used to call forth spirits into one's service and keep them in your service. Different mages have different approaches to summoning, binding, and branding, normally heavily impacted by their paradigm.

Binding (Potency):
------------------
Binding is the skill of forcing spirits into long-term service. Often mastered by mages who don't care about ethics, it brings with it an astral stain that can make summoning more difficult.

Branding (Potency):
-------------------
Branding is the art of linking onesself with a spirit in a mutually agreeable manner, but taps the spirit directly to the mage's life energy, making it a risky ploy.

* Specializations: Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Beast, Humanity, Plant, Task, Guidance, Guardian

Summoning (Potency):
--------------------
Summoning is the act of merely pulling forth spirits from the astral world towards the gaiasphere and the summoner. Most spirits will also aid the summoner simply in exchange for seeing a bit of the world, in the short term, but the link is weak.
