Industrial Skills (Crafting):
=============================
Industrial skills are used to build items, normally from base components but also occasionally from scratch or purely using fabricators. In a few instances, they can also be used to modify itemsand make them more effective.

Gunsmithing (Logic):
--------------------
The real reason you're looking at this group. Gunsmithing is the skill used to build guns, all guns, from their components. See the crafting rules for details.

* Specializations: Pistols, Small Arms, Longarms, Heavy Weapons, Design

Metalworking (Intuition):
-------------------------
While this is sometimes still done with a forge proper, more often a factory or a fabricator will do for building things out of metal - any metal.

* Specializations: Armor, Tools, Weapons, Design

Clothworking (Intuition):
-------------------------
Clothworking is used for making and modifying objects made of cloth, leather, and other softer materials, including the underlays of certain armor - such as making an *aketon* to be worn under plate.

* Specializations: Armor, Clothing, Weapons, Design

Engineering (Logic):
--------------------
Engineering is a catch-all skill for objects that use high-tech materials such as plastics or combine multiple materials (which are assumed to be bought already crafted as components), and can be made exclusively from advanced fabrication equipment.

* Specializations: Armor, Disguises, Equipment, Medical, Weapons, Design
