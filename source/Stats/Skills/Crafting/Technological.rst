Technological Skills (Crafting):
================================
Technological crafting skills are used to create and modify high-tech objects, such as computers, cyberware, et cetera.

Biotechnology (Logic):
----------------------
Biotechnology includes the basics of genetic engineering, fundamental physiological studies, and cloning procedures; everything you need to build your own bioware, except incredibly expensive facilities and years of research data.

* Specializations: Bioware, Geneware, Implantation, Design

Chemistry (Logic):
------------------
Chemistry would almost be left by the side with abstract physics if it weren't that the world relies on all sorts of drugs to be profitable, pleasant, and sometimes even healthy.

* Specializations: Drugs, Pharmaceuticals, Compounds, Toxins, Design

Cybertechnology (Logic):
------------------------
Cybertechnology is the skill used for the crafting of new cyberware, shiny chrome that replaces flesh, including linking the computers within 'ware to the nervous system.

* Specializations: Cyberware, Nanoware, Implantation, Design

Hardware (Logic):
-----------------
Hardware is the skill of dealing purely with computers. While other skills may assume computer components to be bought prepared, Hardware is the skill of putting together advanced circuitry and connecting it to the somewhat mysterious Matrix.

* Specializations: Netboxes, Commlinks, Cyberterminals, Smart Devices, Design
