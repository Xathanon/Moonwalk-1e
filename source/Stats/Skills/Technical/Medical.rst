Medical Skills (Technical):
===========================
Medical skills are used for treatment of injuries, from magical poisons to bullet wounds to bludgeoning trauma.

Diagnosis (Intuition):
----------------------
Diagnosis is the skill of figuring out what's wrong with someone; While in many instances this is obvious, in many more, such as obscure magical issues or even neuropathological diseases, it is much, much less so.

* Specializations: Physical, Mental, Magical

First Aid (Logic):
------------------
First Aid is used to provide emergency aid to the injured; most injuries can at least be allayed by the use of this training, as well as the stabilization of those who are in the process of dying of unnatural causes.

* Specializations: Energy Damage, Magical Injury, Physical Projectiles, Toxins

Extended Care (Logic):
----------------------
Extended Care provides assistance to those recovering from injuries; while it does not directly allay injuries, with the proper facilities it can make recovering even from the most grevious wounds a matter of a few days.
