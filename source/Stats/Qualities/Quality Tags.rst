Quality Tags:
=============
Quality tags are shared characteristics of certain qualities.

[Definition]
------------
Definition qualities are all mutually incompatible. Once you have taken one definition quality, you cannot take any others. They are named as such because they define a character's role in the party.

[Creation]
----------
Creation qualities can only be taken during the process of character creation; afterwards, acquiring them is impossible unless otherwise ruled by the GM.
