Traits:
=======
Traits are added to your character by choices in character creation and significant events afterwards. Most commonly, they are added by a subrace, but some Qualities may also assign certain traits, and some can even be acquired using some gear and â€˜ware. Traits can be either positive or negative.

Positive traits are normally referenced with [square brackets] around them, and negative traits are normally referenced with {curly brackets}. Positive and negative traits are also subdivided into magical, digital, mental, or physical trait types; each has its effects based in the relevant world to which it belongs.
