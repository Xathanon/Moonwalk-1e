# Moonwalk-1e
This project exists to make a more streamlined, more functional, and all-around better experience, in a similar if not identical setting to Shadowrun.

Core Principles:
------------------
Core mechanic of a pool of d6s and counting 'hits'
Physical world that functions at a fast pace while retaining complexity and verisimilitude
Astral world streaked with esoteric horror and mysticism
Digital world that is both familiar and alien to modern sensibilities
"The House Always Wins" in an urban fantasy / cyberpunk dystopia mix
Players are "Moonwalkers," professional criminals and deniable assets for hire
A sense of ongoing basic horror in the world

Design Principles:
-----------------
Characters specialize in one of five areas: Social, Physical, Astral, Digital, and Vehicle
All specializations are able to contribute in any circumstance
Multispecialized characters are less effective than fully specialized characters
Specializations can be approached from three avenues: magic, 'ware, or matrix
Everything has a price: Magic costs your body, 'Ware costs your essence, Matrix costs your mind.
